Margins to be maintained from a designated water body shall be as prescribed in these \nRules. \n2 In any land designated under any legislation, for public purpose, the uses shall be permissible as \nper the requirements of these Rules. \n3 The land/plot allotted to any Government or Government Autonomous body like Municipality,  \nDistrict Panchayat, Planning and Development Authority, or a Government Company  under \nTown Planning  Scheme for public purpose shall be utilized for uses under 'Public Purpose' as per \nthe applicable zones or road widths  prescribed in these Rules subject to suspension of any \nprovision of these Rules by the Government under Section 6 4 of the Act . \n3A Subject to these General Development Rules , the government may undertake any development \nwithout obtaining any permission under GDR, whether of a temporary or permanent nature, that \nare crucial for the community's well -being and public welfare. However, they must first secure \nthe requisite approval from the competent authority as mandated by a pplicable laws, orders, \nnotifications, or circulars that may be in effect at any given time.  \n4 Every development shall have to conform with the presently recommended land  use except in the \nfollowing cases:  \na) The existing buildings constructed as per previously recommended land use shall be allowed \nto be repaired or retrofitted.  \nb) The old use shall be permitted only until the useful life of the building.  \nc) Subject to these General Development Rules, any new development shall be permitted only \nwhen it conforms with the presently recommended land use in the presently earmarked zone. \nProvided that any person who has done part construction in his building unit i n accordance \nwith a valid construction permission, shall be allowed to apply for construction permission \nin conformity with the use to which the building unit is being used for within one year of the \nfinal publication of these rules. Provided further that any new construction shall have to \ncomply with existing CRZ, Coast Guard, ASI regulations  and Ministry of Environment, \nForest and Climate Change Notifications etc.  \n5 For all zones, if the line of a zone divides a building unit, the right of the plot holder to the \nFSI shall be determined as per following principles.  \na) For plots whose part comes under CRZ, Coast Guard , Eco Sensitive Zone or ASI the owner  \n/ developer may either treat his plot as constituted of two separate plots and construct two \nbuildings consuming the FSI  available on these hypothetical parts —calculated on the basis \nof area of these supposed parts , or he may consume higher FSI available calculated on the \nbasis of area of entire plot subject to condition that he shall be allowed construction only on \nthe part of the plot where higher FSI is available.  \nb) If in such cases the Developer goes with First option, the u se of each building unit shall be \nregulated as per respective  zones.  \nIn both cases , other development restrictions shall be applicable.  \nc) For cases, where 50% or more plot falls in the higher FSI zone then the developer shall be \nallowed higher of the two FSIs available. If less than 50% of the plot falls in higher of the \ntwo FSI zones, then then the maximum permissible built up shall be base d on the FSI of the \nrespective zone.  \nFor contiguous development, the maximum  permissible built-up area in the building unit shall  be \nbased on FSI of respective zone.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I) -B, 2023  \nPage No 64  Dadra and Nagar Haveli  Planning and Development Authority  6 Utility structures shall be permitted in any  zone except Preservation Zones but shall be subject to \nall applicable Rules and Regulations for the time being in force.  \n7 Permissible uses of a building shall be determined by the zone , the plot area  and the abutting road \nwidth of the building unit .   \n8 For Eco -Sensitive Zone  / Area shall also confirm the notification published by the “Ministry of \nEnvironment and Forest”, Notification no. S.O. 1067 , dated, 14th September  2006” and  amended \nfrom time to time.  \n9 Any mixed -use building having industry as one of the use s, shall only be allowed in industrial \nzone. Residential and Industrial use shall not be allowed in the same building.  \n10 Land  Use Zoning in Hazard Prone Areas  \nIn natural hazard prone areas namely the earthquake prone zones as per IS:1893, the cyclone \nprone areas as per IS:875 Part  – 3 and flood prone areas as per the Flood Atlas prepared by the \nCentral Water Commission and/or the flood departments of the Government , the development \nshall be regulated to ensure special protection from hazards for any type of development \nirrespective of use zone.  Whereas the hazard prone areas identified as per the Vulnerability Atlas \nof India , 1997  (hereinafter referred as Atlas)  (or revisions thereof) prepared by Gov ernment of \nIndia or as may be prepared by Government from time to time shall be used for such regulations, \nas given in Appendix  B of the Atlas.  Further action for protection from these hazards is to be \ndealt with taking into consideration the guidelines given in Table  No. 7.1 hereunder : \n \nTable No.7.1: Protection of Buildings Structure s and Infrastructure s in Hazard Prone  Areas  \nA Protection o f Areas from Earthquakes  \n(i) In those areas where there are no dangers of soil liquefaction or settlements or landslides, all \nbuilding structures and infrastructures should be designed using the relevant Indian Standards as \nprovided in the Building Regulations and the National Building Code  \n(ii) Soils subjected to liquefaction potential under earthquake shaking, can be improved by \ncompaction to desired relative densities, so as to prevent the possibility of liquefaction.  \n(iii) Buildings and structures could be founded on deep bearing piles going to non - liquefiable dense \nlayers.  \n(iv) Steep slopes can be made more stable by terracing and construction of retaining walls and breast \nwalls, and by ensuring good drainage of water so that the saturation of the hill -slope is avoided.  \n(v) Any other appropriate engineering intervention to save the building structures or infrastructure \nfrom the fury of the earthquake.  \nNote:  \nThe protective action given under (ii) to (v) in this table, will usually involve large amount of costs and \nshould only be considered in the case of large and costly structures.   For ordinary buildings the cost of \nimprovement of the site will usually be uneconomical, hence bad sites should be excluded by Land Use \nZoning.  \n \nB Protection  from Cyclonic Wind Damage  \ni) Buildings, structures,  and infrastructures in the cyclone prone areas should be designed according \nto the Indian Standards and Guidelines as provided in the Regulations and the latest National \nBuilding Code.  \nii) Light utility structures used for electrical transmission and distribution, and towers for \ncommunications, chimneystacks of industrial structures require special design considerations \nagainst the cyclonic wind pressures, suctions,  and uplifts.  \niii) In case the buildings, structures and infrastructures are founded on marine clay deposits it will be \nadvisable to adopt either under -reamed piled foundations, or individual column footing with a \nreinforced concrete beam located at the level of the ground,  or a continuous reinforced concrete \nstrip footing.  \niv) Wherever, the topsoil  could become slushy due to flooding, the top layer of 30 cm depth of soil \nshould not be considered for providing lateral stability.  \nv) In storm surge prone areas, it will be preferable to construct the community structures, like \nschools, cyclone shelters, etc. by raising the level of the ground protected by provision of retaining \nwalls at sufficient distance away from the building, taken to such depth that no erosion takes place \ndue to receding storm surge. Alternatively, construct the community s tructures on stilts with no \nmasonry or bracing up to the probable maximum surge level.  \n \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I) -B, 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli  Planning and Development Authority   Page No 65 C Protection of Areas from  Floods  \nThis may require one or more of the following actions : \ni) Construction of embankments against the water spills from the source of flooding like rivers, \nlarge drain etc.  \nii) Construction of high enough embankments  / bund s around the planning area.  \niii) Raising the planning area above the high flood level.  \niv) Construction  / improvement of drainage paths to effectively drain the water from the planning \narea.  \nv) Construction of buildings and structures on deep foundations going below the depth of scour or  \non stilts with deep enough foundations underwater.  \nvi) Flood proofing works such as the following:  \nvii) Providing quick drainage facility, consisting of  \na) Revitalisation of secondary and primary drainage channels after establishing the drainage \nblockage points.  \nb) Provision of additional waterways.  \nc) Clearing of clogged cross drainage works.  \nviii) Providing human and animal Shelters for population living within embankments in the form of \nraised platform or use of available high ground.  \nix) Anti-erosion actions in affected areas.  \nx) Any other suitable measure.  \n \nNote s: \n1 Similar protection methods could be used against flooding caused in cyclone prone areas by high \nintensity rains or by the storm surge.  \n2 The concept of land zoning should be kept in mind for areas where protection works are taken up to \ndecide inter -se priority for location of structures considering possibility of failure of protection works \nduring extreme disaster events . \n \n15 For Railway Container Depot the permission shall be issued for development of structures of the \nRailway Department . \n16 Permissible uses as mentioned in Table No. 7.2 are broad indicators of the type of use permissible \nin each zone.  In case any dispute arises whether or not an activity falls within the permissible \nuse of a zone, concerned Planning and  Development Authority shall be the Competent Authority \nto decide such issue.  \n17 In case of mixed -use buildings with residential and permissible non-residential  uses, either on the \nground floor or any other floors, they shall be provided with separate means of access / staircase.  \n \nTable No. 7.2: Classification of Land Use Zones and Permissible Uses in Outline Development Plan,  \n(DNH  District ) \nNo. Zones  Conceptualized \nZone  Code  Permissible Use referred as code  \n(Code detailed in Table No. 7.3)  \n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) \n1 Preservation Zone -I \n(Wildlife Sanctuary)  Preservation \nZone  PZ-I EP1, EP2  \n2 Preservation Zone -\nII \n(Reserved Forest)  Preservation \nZone  PZ-II EP1, EP2, REC1, TEMP (Except \nConcrete batching plant)  \n3 Preservation Zone -

It will need s pace and power  for installation of common \nducts, optical fibre, small cells, antennas, smart sensors etc.  Earthing requirements may also be \nthere for some ICT. In some cases , there may be more specific requirements  for utility spaces such \nas: \n• Cable routing layout and cable length restrictions between Workspace  and utility closet.  \n• Bending radius and  working clearance requirements for different cable  types, e.g. Fiber  optic \ncables, Cat -6 Cables and co -axial cables . \n• Isolated power circuits for permanent communication equipment . \n• Protection,  Safety, Grounding,  and environmental requirements of  communication equipment.  \n \n13.11.1  Solutions for In -Buildings and Gated Buildings  \n1 The buildings are to be constructed in such a way that they are ‘digital connectivity ’ ready.  For \nthis they need to provide  common telecom ducts / pathways to reach accessible parts of the \nbuildings.  They should also have properly demarcated sections within buildings and on \nrooftops  for housing broad band / digital connectivity infrastructure / antenna.   These areas \nshould have access to power supply for reliable,  always -on services.  \n2 These common telecom ducts / pathways can be used /shared  by various TSPs/IP -1s for laying / \ndigital infrastructure including cables.    \n3 Further the TSPs/IP -1s shall be given unhindered access inside the buildings to install the \ntelecom  infrastructure / cables etc , as well as for their maintenance .  This access can be free of \ncharge or for a standardized nominal charge like other utilities.   \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I) -C, 2023  \nPage No 140  Dadra and Nagar Haveli  Planning and Development Authority  13.11. 2 Provisions a t the Layout Level  \n1 While developing Greenfield cities/towns, the layout plans should clearly indicate the telecom \nas Utility infrastructure lines.  \n3 The placement and sequence of above  and below -ground utilities at the appropriate location in \nthe right -of-way shall be ensured for unconstrained movement as well as easy access for \nmaintenance.  \n4 Telecommunication cables should be placed in a duct that can be accessed at frequent service \npoints with sufficient spare capacity to enable scaling and future expansion, and empty pipes \n(large size hume pipes / HDPE pipes) should be laid before planting trees in order to \naccommodate additional infrastructure.  \n5 Telecommunication cables should ideally be placed below the parking area or service lane, \nwhich may be dug up easily without causing major inconvenience. Where this is not possible, \nthe cables may be placed at the outer edge of the right -of-way.  \n6 There is a need to reduce conflicts with pedestrian movements is to place telecom boxes in \neasements just off the right -of-way. Where this is not possible, they should be placed within \nparking or landscaping areas. If cables have to be located in the pedestrian path, a space of at \nleast 2m should be maintained for the through movement of pedestrians. Telecom boxes should \nnever constrain the width of a cycle track.  \n7 To minimize disruptions, cables should be installed with proper maintenance infrastructure.  \n \n13.11.3  Provision of I n Building Solution C omponents (as per NBC 2016)  \n1 Entrance Facilities (EF) /Lead -in conduits: ( NBC 2016 Clause 3.1.4, of Part VIII: Sec 6) min. \n1.2 m x 1.83 m space to be allocated for each TSP adjacent to the Entrance Facility.  \n2 Underground conduits/pipes to MDF room: min 100mm dia encased conduits.  \n3 Main Distribution Frame (MDF)/Equipment Room  (ER):  \n(NBC 2016 C lause 3.1.2, Part VIII: Sec 6)  \na) prescribed size with L:W ratio between 1:1 to 2:1  \nb) appropriate ventilation of MDF room  \nc) proper Lighting for vision of equipment.  \nd) located at a level above from the ground level  to avoid incidence of  flooding  \n4 Electric distribution panels, isolators , sockets and earthing as per specific  requirements w ith \nrespect to  the area proposed for coverage (DUs/ service subscribers) . \n5 Telecommunications Room (TR) at each building block unless provided with  MDF room  (all \nprovisions of space to be as per NBC 2016 Clause 3.1.3.2, Part VIII: Sec 6)  \n6 Appropriate nos. of  Service  / Telecom risers (vertical shafts) for all multi  storeyed  buildings \nw.r.t the area proposed for coverage (DUs/ service subscribers):  \na) of appropriate numbers  and size (width & depth) to accommodate cable trays  \nb) with access door at each floor.  \n7 Telecommunications Enclosures  (TE) at each floor of a block or TR  (NBC 2016 Clause 3.1.5, \nPart VIII: Sec 6) . \n8 Telecom Media and Connecting Hardware  (TE)  (NBC 2016 Clause 3.2, Part VIII: Sec  6) \n9 Various cabling system and trays  (NBC 2016 C lause 3.2.4, Part VIII: Sec  6) \n10 Wireless systems  (NBC 2016 C lause 3.2.5, Part VIII: Sec  6) \n11 Backbone Cabling Media Distribution and Building pathways  (NBC 2016 Clause 3.3, Part VIII: \nSec 6) \n12 Horizontal Cabling Media Distribution and B uilding pathways  (NBC 2016 Clause 3.4, Part \nVIII: Sec  6) \n13 IBS installation spaces: area for rooms or systems (eg. , antennas, base  stations, remote units, \npower distribution boxes etc.) to be provided as per  requirements w ith respect to the area \nproposed for coverage/ no. of proposed users ( NBC 2016 C lause 3.1.3.2, Part VIII: Sec  6 and \nTable No. 13.10 & 13.11 ) \n  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I) -C, 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli  Planning and Development Authority   Page No 141 Table No. 13. 10: Telecom room space norm for buildings with Built -up area >465 sq  m \nNo Area to be covered by IBS  Size of Telecom Room (m)  \n1 Upto 465 sq m  3 x 2.4  \n2 465 sq m to 930 sq m  3 x 3.4  \n3 More than 930 sq m  Additional TR required with same space norms  \n \n \nTable No. 13. 11: Space requirements  for smaller buildings with Built -up area <465 sq  m \nNo Area to be covered by IBS  Space provisions (m)  \n1 Upto 93 sq m  Wall cabinets, self – contained enclosed cabinets  \n2 93 sq m  to 465 sq m  Shallow Room (0.6 x 2.6)  \nWalk -in Room (1.3 x 1.3)  \n \n \nIBS installation s paces, so provided, should be:  \n1 Not susceptible to flooding.  \n2 Not exposed to water, moisture, fumes, gases, or dust.  \n3 Able to withstand designed equipment load (to be specified in design)  \n4 Located away from any vibrations to avoid dislocation/dislodgement.  \n \n13.11.4  Proce ss for obtaining IBS -NOC for Development permission and Occupancy \nCertificate  \n1 While submitting the application of development permission, the applicant shall also submit : \na) A complete Service Plan for IBS -infrastructure along with required  specifications (in \nconsultation with, and certified by a credible Telecom  Networking hardware -consultant)  \nb) An undertaking that such IBS Infrastructure, when constructed shall be  available for \nsharing by various TSPs/IP -Is. \n2 Such Service Plan (IBS) shall be forwarded by the concerned Local  Authority to the Telecom \nEnforcement Resource and Monitoring (TERM)  cell of the State  (external NOC agency) – for \napproval NOC.  \n3 During the Joint Site Inspection of the completed building structure the  TERM cell shall \nundertake inspection of the constructed/installed IBS  infrastructure – for issuance of NOC for \nOC. \n4 The Competent  Authority shall liaise with the TERM cell as per its relevant  online/offline \nprocess of communication to seek the relevant NOCs within  the specified time as per the \nService Charter  / Service Guarantee Act and  rules in place.

In auditoriums, theatres, \nconcert halls and such other places of assembly, the illumination of floor exit/access \nmay be reduced during period of performances to values not less than 2 lux.  \nv) Required illumination shall be arranged such that the failure of any single lighting \nunit, such as the burning out of one luminaire, will not leave any area in darkness and \ndoes not impede the functioning of the system further.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 33 vi) The emergency lighting shall be provided to be put on within 5s of the failure of the \nnormal lighting supply. Also, emergency lighting shall be able to maintain the \nrequired illumination level for a period of not less than 90 min in the event of failure \nof the normal lighting even for smaller premises.  \nvii) Battery pack emergency lighting, because of its limited duration and reliability, shall \nnot be allowed to be used in lieu of a diesel engine driven emergency power supply.  \nviii) Escape lighting luminaires should be sited to cover the following locations:  \n• Near each intersection of corridors,  \n• At exits and at each exit door,  \n• Near each change of direction in the escape route,  \n• Near each staircase so that each flight of stairs receives direct light,  \n• Near any other change of floor level,  \n• Outside each final exit and close to it, \n• Near each fire alarm call point,  \n• Near firefighting equipment, and  \n• To illuminate exit and  safety signs  as required by the enforcing authority.  \nix) The luminaires shall be mounted as low as possible, but at least 2 m above the floor \nlevel.  \nx) Signs are required at all exits, emergency exits and escape routes, which should \ncomply with the graphic requirements of the relevant Indian Standards.  \nb) Exit passageway  (at ground) and staircase lighting shall also be connected to alternative \nsupply.  The alternative source of supply may be provided by battery continuously trickle \ncharged from the electric mains.  \nc) Suitable arrangements shall be made by installing double throw switches to ensure that the \nlighting installed in the staircase and the corridor does not get connected to two sources of \nsupply simultaneously.  Double throw switch shall be installed in the service room for \nterminating the stand -by supply.   \nThe emergency lighting system shall be well maintained by periodical inspections and tests \nso as to ensure their perfect serviceability at all times.  \n \nd) Exit Signage  \nWhere exit access is provided through corridors/paths, the occupants shall be able to easily \nidentify the way to exits.  Exit signs shall be provided such that no point in an exit access \nis more than 30 m from a visible exit directional sign. An exit sign indicating the direction \nto an exit shall be provided at all changes in direction.  \nExits shall be clearly visible and the route to reach the exits shall be clearly marked and \nsigns posted to guide the occupants of the floor concerned.  Signs shall be illuminated and \nwired to an independent electrical circuit on an alternative source of supply.  The sizes and \ncolours of the exit signs shall be in accordance with good practice  (Refer Annexure K(7)).  \nThe colour of the exit signs shall be green.7 \nThe exit sign with arrow indicating the way to the escape route shall be provided at a \nsuitable height from the floor level on the wall and shall be illuminated by electric light \nconnected to corridor circuits.  All exit way marking signs should be so installed that no \nmechanical damage shall occur to them due to moving of furniture or other heavy \nequipment.  Further, all landings of floor shall have floor indicating boards prominently \nindicating the number of the floor.  Photo luminescent markings shall be pasted at internal \nhydrant boxes.  \n \n7 Air Conditioning, Ventilation and Smoke Control  \n \na) Air conditioning and mechanical ventilation requirements of different rooms or areas in \nany occupancy shall be in accordance with  Part VIII ‘Building Services Section I Lighting \n \n7 Note:  This provision shall not apply to  A-2 and A -4 occupancies less than 15m in height.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 34  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  and Natural Ventilation and ‘Section III Air conditioning, Heating and Mechanical \nVentilation’ National Building Code.  \nAir conditioning and ventilating systems shall be so installed and maintained as to \nminimise the danger of spread of fire, smoke or fumes from one floor to other or from \noutside to any occupied building or structure.  \nMany high -rise buildings integrate smoke management systems into their conventional \nHVAC systems. In such installation, it requires special design considerations, including \nsafe and adequate controls, acceptable and documented testing, and regular maintenance \nsystems.  \n \nWherever batteries are provided, the same shall be segregated by 120 min fire rated \nconstruction.  Ventilation to the room shall be provided as per manufacturer’s instructions.  \n \nb) Air Handling Unit  \ni) From fire safety point of view, Separate air handling units (AHU) for each floor shall \nbe provided so as to avoid the hazards arising from spread of fire and smoke through \nthe air conditioning ducts. The air ducts shall be separate from each AHU to its floor \nand in no way shall interconnect with the duct of any other floor.  Within a floor it \nwould be desirable to have separate air handling unit provided for each compartment.  \n \nAir handling unit shall be provided with effective means for preventing circulation of \nsmoke through the system in the case of a fire in air filters or from other sources \ndrawn into the system and shall have smoke sensitive devices for actuation in \naccordance with the accepted standard and control.  \n \nii) Shafts or ducts  8, if penetrating multiple floors, shall be of masonry construction with \nfire damper in connecting ductwork or shall have fire rated ductwork with fire \ndampers at floor crossing.  Alternatively, the duct and equipment may be installed in \nroom having walls, doors and fire damper in duct exiting/entering the room of 120 \nmin fire resistance rating.   Such shafts and ducts shall have all passive fire control \nmeeting 120 min fire resistance rating requirement to meet the objective of isolation \nof the floor from spread of fire to upper and lower floors through shaft/duct work.  \niii) The air filters of the air handling units shall be made of non -combustible materials.  \niv) The air handling unit room shall not be used for storage of any combustible materials.  \n \nc) Duct Work  \ni) Air ducts serving main floor areas, corridors, etc., shall not pass through the exits/exit \npassageway/ exit enclosure.  Exits and lift lobbies, etc., shall not be used as return air \npassage.  \nii) As far as possible, metallic ducts shall be used even for the return air instead of space \nabove the false ceiling.  \niii) Wherever the ducts pass through fire walls or floors, the opening around the ducts \nshall be sealed with materials having fire resistance rating of the compartment.  Such \nduct shall also be provided with fire dampers at all fire walls and floors unless such \nducts are required to perform for fire safety operation; and in such case fire damper \nmay be avoided at fire wall and floor while integrity of the duct shall be maintained \nwith 120 min fire resistance rating to allow the emergency operations for fire safety \nrequirements.  \niv) The ducting within compartment would require minimum fire resistance rating of 30 \nmin.  Such ducting material in substantial gauge shall be in accordance. If such duct \ncrosses adjacent compartment/floor and not having fire dampers in such \ncompartment/floor, it will require fire resistance duct work rating of 120 min.  The \n \n8 Zoned and compartmented HVAC systems are encouraged with and approach to avoid common exhaust shafts and fresh \nair intake shafts which will limit the requirements of such passive measure and fire rated duct work and dampers.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 35 requirements of support of the duct shall meet its functional time requirement as \nabove.  \nv) The materials used for insulating the duct system (inside or outside) shall be of non -\ncombustible type.  Any such insulating material shall not be wrapped or secured by \nany material of combustible nature.  \nvi) Inspection panels shall be provided in the ductwork to facilitate the cleaning \naccumulated dust in ducts and to obtain access for maintenance of fire dampers.  \n \nd) Fire or Fire/Smoke Dampers  \nI) These dampers shall be evaluated to be located in supply air ducts, fresh air and return \nair ducts/ passages at the following points:  \n• At the fire separation wall,  \n• Where ducts/passages enter the vertical shaft,  \n• Where the ducts pass through floors, and  \n• At the inlet of supply air duct and the return air duct of each compartment on \nevery floor.  \nii) Damper shall be of motorized type/fusible link.  \nDamper shall be so installed to provide complete integrity of the compartment with all \npassive fire protection sealing.  Damper should be accessible to maintain, test and also \nreplace, if so required. Damper shall be integrated with Fire Alarm Panel and shall be \nsequenced to operate as per requirement and have interlocking arrangement for fire \nsafety of the building. Manual operation facilities for damper operation shall also be \nprovided.  \n \n8 Heating   \na) Installation  of Chimney and heating apparatus shall be in accordance with the good \npracti ce (Refer Annexure K  (10)) . \nb) Boiler Rooms  \ni) Provisions of boiler and boiler rooms shall conform to The Boilers Act, 1923.  \nii) Further, the following additional aspects may be taken into account in the location of \nboiler room:  \n• The boilers shall be installed in a fire resisting room of 180 min fire resistance \nrating.  \n• Entry to this room shall be provided with a composite door of 120 min fire \nresistance rating.  \n• The boiler room shall be provided with its dedicated natural or mechanical \nventilation system. Mechanical ventilation system for the boiler room would be \naccepted with 120 min fire resistance rating ductwork, if it has interface with other \nmechanical areas.  Ventilation system should not be allowed to be routed through \nelectrical room area or through exit corridor/exits.  \n• The oil tank for the boiler shall be provided with a dyked enclosure having a \nvolumetric capacity of at least 10 percent more than the volume of the oil tank. \nThe enclosure shall be filled with sand for a height of 300 mm.  \n \n9 Glazing  \na) The glazing shall be in accordance with Part VI Structural Design, Section VIII Glass and \nGlazing. of the National Building Code.  The entire glazing assembly shall be rated to that \ntype of construction as given in Table No. 14.3.  The use of glass shall not be permitted for \nenclosures of exits and exit passageway.  \nThis shall be applicable along with other provisions of this Part related to respective uses \nas specified therein.  The use of glass shall not be permitted for enclosures of exits and exit \npassageway.  \n \n \n \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 36  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  b) Glass facade  shall be in accordance with the following:  \ni) For fully sprinklered9 buildings having fire separation of 9 m or more, tempered glass \nin a non -combustible assembly, with ability to hold the glass in place, shall be \nprovided.  It shall be ensured that sprinklers are located within 600 mm of the glass \nfacade providing full coverage to the glass.  \nii) All gaps between floor -slabs and facade assembly shall be sealed at all levels by \napproved fire -resistant sealant material of equal fire rating as that of floor slab to \nprevent fire and smoke propagation from one floor to another.  \niii) Openable panels shall be provided on each floor and shall be spaced not more than 10 \nm apart measured along the external wall from centre -to-centre of the access \nopenings.  Such openings shall be operable at a height between 1.2 m and 1.5 m from \nthe floor and shall be in the form of openable panels (fire access panels) of size not \nless than 1000 mm X 1000 mm opening outwards.  \nThe wordings, FIRE OPENABLE PANEL OPEN IN CASE OF FIRE, DO NOT \nOBSTRUCT of at least 25 mm letter height shall be marked on the internal side. Such \npanels shall be suitably distributed on each floor based on occupant concentration. \nThese shall not be limited to cubicle areas and shall be also located in common \nareas/corridors to facilitate access by the building occupants and fire personnel for \nsmoke exhaust in times of distress.  \n \n10 Surface Interior Finishes  \na) The use of combustible surface finishes on walls (including facade of the building) and \nceilings affects the safety of the occupants of a building. Such finishes tend to spread the \nfire and even though the structural elements may be adequately fire resistant, serious \ndanger to life may result.  It is, therefore, essential to have adequate precautions to  \nminimise spread of flame on wall, facade of building and ceiling surfaces.  The finishing \nmaterials used for various surfaces and decor shall be such that it shall not generate toxic \nsmoke/fumes.   \n \nb) The susceptibility of various types of wall surfaces to fire is determined in terms of the rate \nof spread of flame.  Based on the rate of spread of flame, surfacing material shall be \nconsidered as divided into four classes as follows:  \ni) Class 1 Surfaces of very low flame spread.  \nii) Class 2 Surfaces of low flame spread.  \niii) Class 3 Surfaces of medium flame spread.  \niv) Class 4 Surfaces of rapid flame spread.  \n \nc) The uses for which surface materials falling into various classes shall be adopted in \nbuilding  construction are given below:  \n \nTable No. 14.4:  Surface Material details for various uses as per class  \nClass 1  \n(1) Class 2  \n(2) Class 3  \n(3) \nMay be \nused in any \nsituation  May be used in any situation, except \non walls, facade of the building, \nstaircase, and corridors.  \nIt sh May be used only in living rooms and bedrooms \n(but not in rooms on the roof) and only as a lining \nto solid walls and partitions1); not on staircases or \ncorridors or facade of the building.  \n1) Panelling (lining) shall be permitted in a limited area.  It shall not be permitted in a vestibule.  \n \n \nd) Materials of Class 4 which include untreated wood fibreboards may be used with due fire -\nretardant treatment as ceiling lining, provided the ceiling is at least, 2.4 m from the top \nsurface of the floor below, and the wall surfaces conform to requirements of class.  Class 4 \n \n9 In case of all other buildings, fire resistance rating of glass facade shall be in accordance with Table  No. 14.3.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 37 materials shall not be used in kitchens, corridors and staircases.  Some materials contain \nbitumen and, in addition to risk from spread of fire, emit dense smoke on burning; such \nmaterials shall be excluded from use under these conditions and shall also not be used for \nconstruction of ceiling where the plenum is used for return air in air -conditioned buildings.  \ne) When frames, walls, partitions or floors are lined with combustible materials, the surfaces \non both sides of the materials shall conform to the appropriate class, because there is \nconsiderable danger from fire starting and rapidly spreading within the concealed cavity \nunknown to the occupants whose escape may be hampered thereby. For detailed \ninformation on materials and details of construction  with their fire resistance rating, \nreference may be made to good practice  (Refer Annexure K  (12)) . \n \n11 Fire Command Centre (FCC)  \na) Fire command centre shall be on the entrance floor of the building having direct access.  \nThe control room shall have the main fire alarm panel with communication system \n(suitable public address system) to aid floors and facilities for receiving the message from \ndifferent floors.  \nb) Fire command centre shall be constructed with 120 min rating walls with a fire door and \nshall be provided with emergency lighting. Interior finishes shall not use any flammable \nmaterials. All controls and monitoring of fire alarm systems, pressurization systems, \nsmoke management systems shall happen from this room. Monitoring of integrated \nbuilding management systems, CCTVs or any other critical parameters in building may \nalso be from the same room.  \nc) Details of all floor plans along with the details of firefighting equipment and installations \n(2 sets laminated and bound) shall be maintained in fire command centre.  \nd) The fire staff in charge of the fire command centre shall be responsible for the maintenance \nof the various services and firefighting equipment and installations in coordination with \nsecurity, electrical and civil staff of the building.  \n \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 38  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  14.3 Life Safety   \n \n14.3.1  General  \nEvery building shall be so designed, constructed, equipped, maintained and operated as to provide \nadequate means of egress to avoid undue danger to the life and safety of the occupants from fire, \nsmoke, fumes or panic during the time period necessary for escape.  \n \nFor high occupancy areas, it may be required to have annunciation, announcements and voice \nguided/aided system to direct the occupants towards safe egress routes, areas of comparative safety \nor exits, and to avoid situation of panic during distress.  \n \nEvery main occupancy may have certain occupancies which may be incidental to the main \noccupancy. The exit requirements pertaining to such incidental occupancies from the floor of the \noccupancy to the level of exit discharge shall be calculated to meet the requirement of the actual \noccupancy of such type, to ensure adequate means of egress of the occupants.  \n \nRefer Part III Development Control Rules and General Building Requirements , National Building \nCode for accessibility for elderly and persons with disabilities, for various requirements for enabling \na smooth and safe egress.  \n \n14.3.2  General Exit Requirements  \n1 An exit may be a fire exit doorway; an internal staircase, exit passageway, external doorway, \nexternal staircase, and these having access to the street or to a veranda or to a refuge area or to \nthe terrace or roof of a building.  An exit may also include a horizontal exit leading to an \nadjoining building/fire compartment having its further access to unlocked/public exit at the \nsame level.  \n2 Unless otherwise specified, lifts, escalators, moving walks and revolving doors shall not be \nconsidered as exits and shall not constitute any part of the required exit.  \n3 Every exit, exit passageway and exit discharge shall be continuously maintained free of all \nobstructions or impediments to full use in the case of fire or other emergency.  \n4 Every building having human occupancy shall be provided with exits sufficient to permit safe \negress of occupants, in case of fire or other emergency.  \n5 In every building or structure, exits shall comply with the minimum requirements of this Part, \nexcept those not accessible for general public use.  \n6 No building shall be so altered as to reduce the number, width or protection of exits to less than \nthat required.  \n7 For non -naturally ventilated areas, fire doors with 120 min fire resistance rating shall be \nprovided and particularly at the entrance to lift lobby and stair well where a funnel or flue effect \nmay be created, inducing an upward spread of fire, to prevent spread of fire and smoke.  \n8 Exits shall be  so arranged that they may be reached without passing through another occupied \nunit/passage in others control, if they pose challenge or restriction in means of egress.  \n9 Doors in exits shall open in the direction of exit.  In case of assembly building ( Group E) and \nHealth (Group D-1), exit door shall not open immediately upon a flight of stair and all such \nentries to the stair shall be through a landing, so that such doors do not impede movement of \npeople descending from a higher floor when fully opened.  While for other occupancies, such \ndoors shall not reduce the pathway in the landing by more than half the width of such staircase.  \nOverhead or sliding doors shall not be installed.  \n10 At least half of the required exit stairs from upper floors (rounded to the next higher number) \nshall discharge directly to the exterior or through exit passageways.  \n11 Unless otherwise specified, all the exits and exit passageways to exit discharge shall have a \nclear ceiling height of at least 2.4 m.  However, the height of exit door shall be at least 2.0 m.  \n12 Where changes in elevation of more than 300 mm are encountered in the exits, ramps or sloped \nsurfaces shall be used with handrails and floor finish materials that contrast with the adjacent \nfinish materials.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 39 13 The capacity of the means of egress required from any storey of the building shall not be \nreduced along the path of egress travel until arrival to the exit discharge.  \n14 The lifts, escalators, moving walks, turnstiles and revolving doors shall not be considered in \ndetermining the required capacity of means of egress for the individual floor(s) or the building.  \n15 Turnstiles or similar devices that restrict travel to one direction or that are used to restrict \nunauthorized entry shall not be so placed as to obstruct any required means of egress. \nAlternative door openings of required exit width shall be available within 3 m of such devices, \nif installed.  \n16 Suitable means shall be provided so that all access -controlled exit doors, turnstiles, boom \nbarriers and other such exits shall automatically operate to open mode during emergencies like \nfire, smoke, acts of terrorism, etc., so that people can safely and quickly egress into safe areas \noutside.  If required , a master controlling device may be installed at a strategic location to \nachieve this.  \n17 Penetrations into and openings through an exit are prohibited except those necessary like for the \nfire protection piping, ducts for pressurization and similar life safety services. Such openings as \nwell as vertical passage of shaft through floors shall be protected by passive systems.  \n18 Walking  surfaces in exit access shall comply with the following requirements for \nsmooth exit:  \na) Walking surfaces  shall be nominally level.  \nb) The slope of walking surface in the direction of travel shall not exceed 1 in 20 unless the \nramp requirements are met.  \nc) Slope perpendicular to the direction of travel shall not exceed 1 in 48.  \nd) Walking surfaces shall be slip -resistant along the entire path of travel.  \n19 Basement  \na) Basement exits shall be sufficient to provide for the capacity of the basement as \ndetermined in accordance with Rule No. 14.3.4 (2).  In no case shall there be less than two \nindependent basement exits.  \nb) Basements having incidental occupancies to main occupancy shall be planned with exit \nrequirements of the basements for the actual occupancy within the basement.  \nc) Where basement is used for car parking and also there is direct approach from any \noccupancy above to the basement, door openings leading to the basement shall need to be \nprotected with fire doors with 120 min fire rating, except for exit discharge doors from the \nbasements.  \n \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 40  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority   \nFigure No. 14.5:  Door Locations at Landing in Fire Exists  \n \n \nFigure No. 14.6:  Minimum Head Room Measurement  \n \n14.3.3  Occupant Load  \nFor determining the exits required, the number of persons within any floor area or the occupant load \nshall be based on the actual number of occupants declared, but in no case less than that specified in \nTable No. 14.1.  The occupant load of a mezzanine floor discharging to a floor below shall be added \nto that floor occupancy and the capacity of the exits shall be designed for the total occupancy load \nthus established.  \n \nThe occupant load of each story considered individually shall be required to be used in computing \nthe number of means of egress at each story, provided that the required number of means of egress is \nnot decreased in the direction of egress travel.  \n \n\nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 41 The assembly occupancies and call centres shall be required to display, limiting occupant load \ndetails positioned in a conspicuous place near the entrance of each of such respective occupancy to \navoid possible overcrowding and overloading.  The display shall preferably be engraved on a metal \nplate of not less than 300 mm × 200 mm, with letters of height and width not less than 50 mm, with \ndetail of occupancy, area and occupancy load.  \n \nThe capacity of any open mezzanine/balcony shall be added to the capacity of the floor below for the \npurpose of determining exit capacity.  \n \n \n \n14.3.4  Egress Components  \nEgress components to be considered are the number of exits to which access is provided, capacity of \nexit access, travel distance to an exit, the obviousness of the direction to an exit, and any hindrance \nincluding due to security issues involved.  \n \n1 Exit Access  \na) A common path of travel is desirable in exit access which leads to two independent \ndirections to separate exits.  \nb) Capacity of exit access: The width of corridors, aisles or ramps required for exit access \nshall be sufficient to ensure a smooth flow of occupants to the exit.  Where a corridor is the \nonly way of access to an exit, the corridor width shall not be less than the calculated exit \nwidth.  \nc) Objects like tables, chairs or any other temporary/permanent structures in exit access \ncorridors shall be avoided as this may result in congestion and impeding smooth flow of \npersonnel during emergencies.  \nd) In order to ensure that each element of the means of egress can be effectively utilized, they \nshall all be properly lit and marked.  Lighting shall be provided with emergency power \nback -up in case of power failures.  Also, exit signs of adequate size, marking, location, and \nlighting shall be provided so that all those unfamiliar with the location of the exits may \nsafely find their way.  \ne) Exit access to fireman’s lift and refuge area on the floor shall be step free and clearly sign \nposted with the international symbol of accessibility.  \nf) Exit access shall not pass through storage rooms, closets or spaces used for similar \npurpose.  \ng) The calculation of capacity of exit access shall be in accordance with  Rule No. 14.3.2(4).  \n \n\nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 42  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority   \nFigure No. 14.7: Dead End Corridor  \n \n2 Exits  \na) Number of Exits  \nThe minimum required number of exits in a building shall be determined based on \noccupant load (Refer  Table No. 14.1) and width required per person (Refer No.  Table 14.1) \nas appropriate to the type of exit for respective occupancies, subject to complying with \nmaximum travel distance requirement (Refer  Table No. 14.1). \n \nb) Arrangement of Exits  \ni) Exits shall be so located that the travel distance on the floor shall not exceed the \ndistance (Refer Table No. 14.1). \nii) Travel distance shall be measured from the most remote point within a storey or a \nmezzanine floor along the natural and un -obstructed path of horizontal or vertical \negress travel to the door to an exit.  \niii) The dead -end corridor length in exit access shall not exceed 6 m for educational, \ninstitutional and assembly occupancies.  For other occupancies, the same shall be 15 \nm. (Refer Figure No.  14.7). \niv) Exits shall be placed as remote from each other as possible and shall be arranged to \nprovide direct access in separate directions from any point in the area served.  \n \nc) Capacities of means of egress.  \ni) Exit capacity is the number of people that can pass through a stairway, and level \ncomponents (door and corridor) and ramps.  The total capacity of all the respective \nmeans of egress serving a floor shall be sufficient to allow egress of the entire \npopulation of the floor.  \nii) The unit of exit width, used to measure the capacity of any exit, shall be 500 mm.  A \nclear width of 250 mm shall be counted as an additional half unit. Clear widths less \nthan 250 mm shall not be counted for exit width.  \niii) Width per person for stairways, and level components and ramps shall be determined \nusing the capacity factors in accordance with Table  No. 14.1.  For example, if an exit \ndoorway measures 1000 mm in clear width, it would be defined as providing exit \ncapacity for 1000/6.5 occupants, that is, 153 persons (say 150 persons) and number of \nsuch exit doorways can then be calculated depending on the occupant load.  \niv) When calculating stairways, level components and ramps and other exit means, the \ncapacity of the entire system shall have to be based upon the minimum capacity \navailable from any part of the system.  The corridor, if so provided shall also to be \nplanned with consideration of exit access adequacy for the number of occupants.  \nFurther, consider the situation of doors opening to an exit stairway.  If the stairway \nprovides an exit capacity of 150 persons, and the doors leading into the stairway \nprovide an e xit capacity of 153 persons, the overall exit system would be considered \n\nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 43 to provide the minimum exit capacity of only 150 persons afforded by the stairway.  \nThe exit planning will be limited by the most restrictive exit calculation under the \nmeans of egress.  \nv) In the procedures for determining required egress capacity, the number of required \nmeans of egress is based on a floor -by-floor consideration, rather than the \naccumulation of the occupant loads of all the floors.

The design should ensure avoidance of spread of smoke to adjacent \nspaces through the various leakage openings in the compartment enclosure, such as \ncracks, openings around pipes ducts, airflow grills and doors.  In the absence of \nproper sealing of all these openings, smoke and toxic gases will obstruct the free \nmovement of occupants of the building through the exits.  Pressurization of staircases \nis of great importance for the exclusion of smoke and toxic gases from the protected \nexit. \nii Pressurization is a method adopted for protecting the exits from ingress of smoke, \nespecially in high -rise buildings.  In pressurization, air is injected into the staircases, \nlobbies, etc, as applicable, to raise their pressure slightly above the pressure in \nadjacent parts of the building.  As a result, ingress of smoke or toxic gases into the \nexits will be prevented.  The pressurization of staircases and lift lobbies shall be \nadopted as given in Table No. 14.5 .  The pressure difference for staircases shall be 50 \nPa. \nPressure differences for lobbies (or corridors) shall be between 25 Pa and 30 Pa.  \nFurther, the pressure differential for enclosed staircase adjacent to such lobby (or \ncorridors) shall be 50 Pa.  For enclosed staircases adjacent to non -pressurized lobby \n(or corridors), the pressure differential shall be 50 Pa.  \niii Equipment and ductwork for staircase pressurization shall be in accordance with one \nof the following:  \n• Directly connected to the stairway by ductwork enclosed in non -combustible \nconstruction.  \n• If ducts used to pressurize the system are passed through shafts and grills are \nprovided at each level, it shall be ensured that hot gases and smoke from the \nbuilding cannot ingress into the staircases under any circumstances.  \niv The normal air conditioning system and the pressurization system shall be designed \nand interfaced to meet the requirements of emergency services.  When the emergency \npressurization is brought into action, the following changes in the normal air \nconditioning system shall be effected.  \n• Any re -circulation of air shall be stopped, and all exhaust air vented to \natmosphere.  \n• Any air supply to the spaces/areas other than exits shall be stopped.  \n• The exhaust system may be continued provided,  \n− the positions of the extraction grills permit a general air flow away from the \nmeans of egress.  \n− the construction of the ductwork and fans is such that, it will not be rendered \ninoperable by hot gases and smoke; and  \n\nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 49 − there is no danger of spread of smoke to other floors by the path of the \nextraction system which can be ensured by keeping the extraction fans \nrunning.  \nv For pressurized stair enclosure systems, the activation of the systems shall be initiated \nby signalling from fire alarm panel.  \nvi Pressurization system shall be integrated and supervised with the automatic/manual \nfire alarm system for actuation.  \nvii Wherever pressurized staircase is to be connected to unpressurized area, the two areas \nshall be segregated by 120 min fire resistant wall.  \nviii Fresh air intake for pressurization shall be away (at least 4 m) from any of the exhaust \noutlets/grille.  \n \nTable No. 14.5: Pressurization of Staircases and Lift Lobbies  \nNo Component1) Width per Person (mm)  \nLess than 15 m  15 m to 30 m  More than 30 m  \n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) \ni) Internal \nstaircase not \nwith external \nwall Pressurized except for residential \nbuildings (A-1 and A -3(Apartment \nhouses))  Pressurized  Pressurized  \nii) Internal \nstaircase with \nexternal wall  Pressurized except for residential \nbuildings (A -1 and A -3(Apartment \nhouses )) or naturally ventilated  Naturally ventilated or \npressurized  Cross -ventilated or \npressurized  \niii) Lift lobby  Not required at ground and above \nHowever lift lobby segregation and \npressurization is required for lift \ncommuting from ground to \nbasement  Naturally ventilated or \nPressurized1) Cross -ventilated or \nPressurized1) \n1) Lift lobby with fire doors (120 min) at all levels with pressurization of 25 -30 Pa is required.  However, if lift lobby \ncannot be provided at any of the levels in air -conditioned buildings or in internal spaces where funnel/flue effect may be \ncreated, lift hoist way shall be pressurized at 50 Pa.  For building greater than 30 m, multiple point injection air inlets to \nmaintain desired pressurization level shall be provided. If the lift lobby, lift and staircase are part of firefighting shaft , lift \nlobby necessarily has to be pressurized in such case, unless naturally ventilated.  \n \nNotes  \n1 The natural ventilation requirement of the staircase shall be, achieved through opening at each landing, of an area 0.5 \nm2 in the external wall.  A cross ventilated staircase shall have 2 such openings in opposite/adjacent walls or the same \nshall be cross ventilated  through the corridor.  \n2 Enclosed staircases leading to more than one basement shall be pressurized.  \n \n14.3.5  Compartmentation  \n1 General  \na) It is important to limit the spread of a fire in any building.  The usual method is to use fire \nbarriers.

The effective capacity of the reservoir above the top of the pump casing \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 64  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  (flooded suction) for various types of occupancies shall be as indicated in Table No. \n14.7. \niii Water for firefighting shall be stored in two or more interconnected compartments of \nequal size to facilitate cleaning and maintenance of the tanks without interrupting the \nwater availability for firefighting.  \niv To prevent stagnation of water in the static water storage tank, the suction tank of the \ndomestic water supply shall be fed only through an overflow arrangement from the \nfire water storage tanks to maintain the level therein at the minimum specified \ncapacity.  \nv Alternatively, domestic and fire water can be stored in two interconnected \ncompartments as mentioned above.  The suction inlet(s) for the domestic water pumps \nshall be so located at an elevation that minimum water requirements for firefighting as \nstated in Table No. 14. 7 will be always available for fire pumps.  \nvi The static storage water supply required for the above mentioned purpose shall \nentirely be accessible to the fire engines of the local fire service. Suitable number of \nmanholes shall be provided for inspection, repairs, insertion of suction hose, etc. As \nan alternative to the arrangement of manholes to allow access from the top, suitable \narrangement to enable efficient access to the tank by the firemen from the adjoining \nfire pump room having direct access from the ground level, shall be made. The \nunderground fire water storage tank(s) shall not be more than 7 m in depth from the \nlevel having fire brigade draw -out connection, while the draw -out connection shall not \nbe more than 5 m away from the tank wall.   The covering slab shall be able to \nwithstand a total vehicular load of 45 t (or as applicable) equally divided as a four -\npoint load when the slab forms a part of pathway/driveway.  \nvii The static water storage tank shall be provided with a fire brigade collecting head with \n4 number 63 mm diameter (2 number 63 mm diameter for pump with capacity 1400 \nlitre/min) instantaneous male inlets arranged in a valve box at a suitable point at street \nlevel.  The same shall be connected to the static tank by a suitable fixed galvanized \niron pipe not less than 150 mm in diameter to discharge water into the tank when \nrequired at the rate of 2250 litre/min, if tank is in the basement or not approachable \nfor the fire engines.  \nviii Each of the static water storage tanks shall also be provided with a fire brigade draw \nout collecting head with 63 mm diameter instantaneous male draw out arranged in a \nvalve box at a suitable point at street level.  This draw out shall be connected to \ngalvanized iron pipe of 100 mm diameter with foot valve arrangement in the tank.  \n \nb) Firefighting pump house  \nThe requirements shall be as given below:  \ni It is preferable to install the pump house at ground level. Pump house shall be situated \nso as to be directly accessible from the surrounding ground level.  \nii Pump house shall be installed not lower than the second basement. When installed in \nthe basement, staircase with direct accessibility (or through enclosed passageway with \n120 min fire rating) from the ground, shall be provided.

Electrical panels may be provided with CO2/inert gas flooding system \nbased on the requirement and reliability of power for the functional requirement and \nperformance.  \n \n14.5. 10 Industrial Buildings (Group  J) \n \n1 Fire Prevention  \na) Fire separating walls, fire separating floors and fire partitions  \nFire separating walls shall be provided between two buildings or between two blocks \ninside a building, having different fire hazards in accordance with the provisions of this \nPart. The areas having storage, manufacturing, hazardous activities such as paint store, oil \nstorage, spray booths, etc., shall be separated from non -hazardous areas like administrative \noffice, staff canteen, etc. by fire rated walls/doors of 120 min fire resistance rating. The fire \nresistance rating of high hazardous areas like petrochemical, explosives shall be 240 min.  \nThe fire separating wall where provided shall comply with the following requirements:  \ni The separating wall shall be carried through the roof. This portion of the wall \nextending above the roof, known as ‘screen wall’ shall be of such a height (in no case \nless than 600 mm) that the horizontal distance at the level of the top of the screen wall \nbetween the roofs of the buildings/compartments being segregated is at least 6 m.  \nii The screen wall shall be of not less than 230 mm in thickness if it is an extension of a \nmasonry wall, and not less than 150 mm in thickness if it is an extension of a \nreinforced concrete wall.  \niii The separating wall need not be extended as a screen wall if the roof of one or both of \nthe buildings/blocks being segregated is of reinforced concrete construction (RCC).  \niv In the case of buildings of unequal height, windows or other openings in the wall of \nthe higher building overlooking the roof of the lower building and within 6 m, thereof, \nshall be protected by fire resistant glass assembly or by approved type fire doors \nunless the roof of the lower building is of reinforced concrete.  \nv In case the eaves of the higher building fall within 6 m of the roof of the lower \nbuilding such eaves should be cut -off and the screen wall raised as a parapet, 600 mm \nhigh over the roof of the higher building, unless the roof of the lower building is of \nRCC construction.  \nvi Fire separating walls shall also be extended outwards on both sides by at least 450 \nmm. \nvii Doors and window openings in external walls within 3 m of the fire separating walls \nshall be protected by fire doors having a rating of at least 60 min and window \nopenings may be protected by fire resistant glass assembly having same fire rating.  \nviii In the case of buildings/compartments having north -light roofs when a separating wall \nruns parallel to the axis of the north -light opening, the screen wall shall be carried \nthrough and 600 mm above the ridge of the north light. If, however, the separating \nwall is at right angles to the axis of the north -light opening, the saw tooth gaps shall \nbe bricked up and the screen wall extended 600 mm above the ridge of the north light \nas well as beyond the extreme north -light opening.  \nix Similarly, the thickness of the floor slabs in case of buildings having upper levels \nshall be designed to provide fire rating as mentioned above.  \nx Storage areas shall be separated from the remainder of the building/block by fire \nwalls.  \nxi Moderate and high hazard areas in industries to have two fire doors each having 180 \nmin fire resistance rating.  \n2 Life Safety   \na) In buildings used for aircraft assembly or other occupancy requiring undivided floor areas \nso large that the distances from points within the area to the nearest outside walls where \nexit doors could be provided are in excess of 45 m, requirements for distance to exits may \nbe satisfied by providing stairs leading to exit tunnels or to overhead passageways. In cases \nwhere such arrangements are not practicable, the Authority may, by special ruling, permit \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 82  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  other exit arrangements for single storeyed buildings with distances in excess of the \nmaximum distances specified in 4, if completely automatic sprinkler protection is provided \nand if the heights of ceiling curtain boards and roof ventilation are such as to minimise the \npossibility that employees will be overtaken by the spread of fire or smoke within 1.8 m of \nthe floor level before they have time to reach exits, provided, however, that in no case may \nthe distance of travel to reach the nearest exit exceed 65 m where smoke venting is \nrequired as a condition for permitting distances of travel to exits in excess of the maximum \notherwise allowed.  \nb) The following shall apply to special purpose industrial occupancies:  \ni Exits need be provided only for the persons actually employed; spaces not subject to \nhuman occupancy because of the presence of machinery or equipment may be \nexcluded from consideration.  \nii Where unprotected vertical openings are necessary to manufacturing operations, these \nmay be permitted beyond the limits specified for industrial occupancy, provided every \nfloor level has direct access to one or more enclosed stairways or other exits protected \nagainst obstruction by any fire in the open areas connected by the unprotected vertical \nopenings or smoke therefrom.  \nc) The following shall apply to high hazard industrial occupancies11: \ni From every point in every floor area, there shall be at least two exits accessible in \ndifferent directions; where floor areas are divided into rooms, there shall be at least \ntwo ways of escape from every room, however small rooms, except toilet rooms, so \nlocated that the points of access thereto are out of or suitably shielded from areas of \nhigh hazard.  \nii In addition to types of exits for upper floors specified  for Group J occupancies, slide \nescapes may be used as required exits for both new and existing buildings.  \n \n3 Additional Precautions  \na) In any room in which volatile flammable substances are used or stored, no device \ngenerating a glow or flame capable of igniting flammable vapour shall be installed or used, \nsuch a room shall be provided with a suitably designed exhaust ventilation system (see \nAnnex ure J). \nb) For detailed information on fire safety of certain individual (specific) industrial \noccupancies, reference may be made to good practice (Refer Annexure K (28))  \nc) Fire protection considerations for venting industrial occupancies shall be as in Annex ure J. \n \n \n \n  \n \n11 NOTE — All high hazard industrial occupancies shall have automatic sprinkler protection, or such other protection as may be \nappropriate to the particular hazard, including explosion venting for any area subject to explosion hazard, designed to minim ise danger to \noccupants in case of fire or other emergency before they have time to utilize exits to escape.  \n \nGeneral Development Rules -

These guidelines are intended to assist them in this task.  \n \nD-2 Alarms  \nAny person discovering fire, heat or smoke shall immediately report such condition to the fire \nbrigade, unless he has personal knowledge that such a report has been made. No person shall make, \nissue, post or maintain any regulation or order, written or verbal, that would require any person to \ntake any unnecessary delaying action prior to reporting such condition to the fire brigade.  \n \nD-3 Drills  \nD-3.1 Fire drills shall be conducted, in accordance with the Fire Safety Plan, at least once every \nthree months for buildings during the first two years. Thereafter, fire drills shall be \nconducted at least once every six months.  \nD-3.2 All occupants of the building shall participate in the fire drill. However, occupants of the \nbuilding, other than building service employees, are not required to leave the floor or use \nthe exits during the drill.  \nD-3.3 A written record of such drills shall be kept on the premises for a three years period and \nshall be readily available for fire brigade inspection.  \n \nD-4 Signs and Plan  \nD-4.1 Signs at Lift Landings  \nA sign shall be posted and maintained in a conspicuous place on every floor at or near the \nlift landing in accordance with the requirements, indicating that in case of fire, occupants \nshall use the stairs unless instructed otherwise. The sign shall contain a diagram showing \nthe location of the stairways except that such diagram may be omitted, provided signs \ncontaining such diagram are posted in conspicuous places on the respective floor.  \n \nA sign shall read ‘IN CASE OF FIRE, USE STAIRS UNLESS INSTRUCTED \nOTHERWISE’. The lettering shall be at least 12.5 mm block letters in red and white \nbackground. Such lettering shall be properly spaced to provide good legibility. The sign \nshall be at least 250 mm × 300 mm, where the diagram is also incorporated in it and 62.5 \nmm × 250 mm where the diagram is omitted. In the latter case, the diagram sign shall be at \nleast 200 mm × 300 mm. The sign shall be located directly above the call -button and \nsquarely attached to the wall or partition. The top of the sign shall not be above 2 m from \nthe floor level.  \n \nD-4.2 Floor Numbering Signs  \nA sign shall be posted and maintained within each stair enclosure on every floor, indicating \nthe number of the floor, in accordance with the requirements given below. The numerals \nshall be of bold type and at least 75 mm high. The numerals and background shall be in \ncontrasting colours. The sign shall be securely attached to the stair side of the door.  \n \nD-4.3 Stair and Lifts Identification Signs  \nEach stairway and each lift bank shall be identified by an alphabetical letter. A sign \nindicating the letter of identification shall be posted and maintained at each lift landing and \non the side of the stairway door from which egress is to be made, in accordance with the \nrequirements given in (Refer 14.3.4.(2))  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 106  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  D-4.4 Stair Re -entry Signs  \nA sign shall be posted and maintained on each floor within each stairway and on the \noccupancy side of the stairway where required, indicating whether re -entry is provided into \nthe building and the floor where such re -entry is provided, in accordance with the \nrequirements given below.  \nThe lettering and numerals of the signs shall be at least 12.5 mm high of bold type. The \nlettering and background shall be of contrasting colours and the signs shall be securely \nattached approximately 1.5 m above the floor level.  \n \nD-5 Fire Safety Plan  \nD-5.1 A format for the Fire Safety Plan shall be as given in D -9.10.  \nD-5.2 The applicable parts of the approved Fire Safety Plan shall be distributed to all tenants of \nthe building by the building management when the Fire Safety Plan has been approved by \nthe Fire Authority.  \nD-5.3 The applicable parts of the approved Fire Safety Plan shall then be distributed by the \ntenants to all their employees and by the building management to all their building \nemployees.  \nD-5.4 In the event there are changes from conditions existing at the time the Fire Safety Plan for \nthe building was approved, and the changes are such so as to require amending the Fire \nSafety Plan, within 30 days after such changes, an amended Fire Safety Plan shall be \nsubmitted to the fire brigade for approval.  \n \nD-6 Fire Command Centre  \nA Fire Command Centre shall be established in the building ( Refer 14.2.4(11))  \n \nD-7 Communications and Fire Alarm  \nA means of communication and fire alarm for use during fire emergencies shall be provided and \nmaintained by the owner or person in charge of the building.  \n \nD-8 Fire Safety Plan Format  \nD-8.1 Building Address  \nStreet and Pin Code Number_______________  \nTelephone Number______________  \n \nD-8.2 Purpose and Objective  \nD-8.2.1  Purpose  \nTo establish method of systematic, safe and orderly evacuation of an area or building by \nand of its occupants in case of fire or other emergency, in the least possible time, to a safe \narea by the nearest safe means of egress; also the use of such available fire appliances \n(including sounding of alarms) as may have been provided for controlling or extinguishing \nfire and safeguarding of human life.  \nD-8.2.2  Objective  \nTo provide proper education as a part of continuing employee indoctrination and through a \ncontinuing written programme for all occupants, to ensure prompt reporting of fire, the \nresponse of fire alarms as designated, and the immediate initiation of fire safety procedures \nto safeguard life and contain fire until the arrival of the fire brigade.  \n \nD-8.3 Fire Safety Director  \na) Name  \nb) Regularly assigned employment — Title \nc) Regularly assigned location.  \nd) How is he notified when at regular location?  \ne) How is he notified when not at regular location?  \nf) Normal working hours  \ng) Duties of Fire Safety Director (see D -9.1)  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 107  \nD-8.4 Deputy Fire Safety Director  \na) Name  \nb) Regularly assigned employment — Title \nc) Regularly assigned location  \nd) How is he notified when at regular location?  \ne) How is he notified when not at regular location?  \nf) Normal working hours  \ng) Duties of Deputy Fire Safety Director (see D -9.2) \n \nD-8.5 Fire Wardens and Deputy Fire Wardens  \na) Are their names on organization charts for each floor and/or tenancy?  \nb) Submit typical completed organization chart for Fire Drill and Evacuation \nAssignment.  \nc) Duties of Fire Wardens and Deputy Fire Wardens (see D -9.3). \n \nD-8.6 Building Evacuation Supervisor  \na) Name  \nb) Regularly assigned employment — Title \nc) Regularly assigned location  \nd) How is he notified when at regular location?  \ne) How is he notified when not at regular location?  \nf) Normal working hours  \ng) Duties of Building Evacuation Supervisor (see D -9.4).  \n \nD-8.7 Fire Party  \na) Submit a completed organization chart for Fire Parties naming person in charge, and \nhis title in the building.  \nb) Indicate standards of selection from building employees based on background and \navailability.  \nc) How are they notified?  \nd) How are they notified when they are not at their regular locations?  \ne) Means of responding  \nf) Duties of each member of Fire Party (see D -9.5). \n \nD-8.8 Occupants Instructions  \nDistribution of instructions of all tenants, tenants’ employees and building  employees (see \nD-9.6). \n \nD-8.9 Evacuation Drills  \na) Frequency of drills  \nb) How conducted?  \nc) Participation?

The owner or the \nother person in -charge of the building shall bring the matter to the attention of the firm \nemploying the individual. If the firm fails to correct the condition, the fire department shall \nbe notified by the owner/person in charge of the building.  \nD-9.1.8  In the event of fire, shall report to the fire command centre to supervise, provide for and \ncoordinate with respect to the following:  \na Ensuring that the fire department has been notified of any fire or fire alarm.  \nb Manning of the fire command station.  \nc Direction of evacuating procedures as provided in the Fire Safety Plan.  \nd Report on conditions on fire floor for information of fire department on their arrival.  \ne Advising the fire department officer in -charge in the operation of the Fire Command \nCentre.  \n \n \n12 Note — If the number of Fire Wardens and Deputy Fire Wardens in the building is such that it is impractical to individually contact \neach one daily, a suggested method to satisfy the requirements is to make provisions for the Fire Warden, or a Deputy Fire Wa rden in \nthe absence of the Fire Warden, to notify the Fire Safety Director when the Fire Warden or required number of Deputy Fire War dens \nare not available. In order to determine the compliance by the Fire Warden and Deputy Fire Wardens, when this method is used,  the \nFire Safety Director shall make a spot check of several different floors each day.  \n \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 109 D-9.1.9  Be responsible for the training and activities of the Building Evacuation Supervisor.  \n \nD-9.2 Deputy Fire Safety Director’s Duties  \n1 He is the subordinate to the Fire Safety Director.  \n2 He shall perform duties of Fire Safety Director in his absence.  \n \nD-9.3 Fire Warden’s and Deputy Fire Warden’s Duties  \nThe tenant or tenants of each floor shall, upon request of the owner or person in charge of \nbuildings, make responsible and dependable employees available for designation by the \nFire Safety Director as Fire Warden and Deputy Fire Wardens.  \nD-9.3.1  Each floor of a building shall be under the direction of a designated Fire Warden for the \nevacuation of occupants in the event of fire. He shall be assisted in his duties by the \nDeputy Fire Wardens. A Deputy Fire Warden shall be provided for each tenancy. When \nthe floor area of a tenancy exceeds 700 m2 of occupiable space, a Deputy Fire Warden \nshall be assigned for each 700 m2 or part thereof.  \nD-9.3.2  Each Fire Warden and Deputy Fire Warden shall be familiar with the fire safety plan, the \nlocation of exits and the location and operation of any available fire alarm system.  \nD-9.3.3  In the event of fire, or fire alarm the Fire Warden shall ascertain the location of the fire, \nand direct evacuation of the floor in accordance with directions received and the following \nguidelines:  \na The most critical areas for immediate evacuation are the fire floor and floors immediately \nabove. Evacuation from the other floors shall be instituted when instructions from the fire \nCommand Centre or conditions indicate such action. Evacuation shall be via \nuncontaminated stairs. The Fire Warden shall try to avoid stairs being used by the Fire \ndepartment. If this is not possible, he shall try to attract the attention of the Fire department \npersonnel before such personnel open the door to the fire floor.  \nb Evacuation to two or more levels below the fire floor is generally adequate. He shall keep \nthe fire command station informed regarding his location.  \nc Fire Wardens and their deputies shall see that all occupants are notified of the fire, and that \nthey proceed immediately to execute the Fire Safety Plan.  \nd The Fire Warden on the fire floor shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Fire Command \nCentre of the particulars.  \ne Fire Wardens on floors above the fire shall, after executing the Fire Safety Plan, notify the \nFire command station of the means being used for evacuation and any other particulars.  \nf In the event that stairways serving fire floor and/or floors above are unusable due to \ncontamination or cut -off by fire and/or smoke or that several floors above fire involve large \nnumbers of occupants who must be evacuated, consideration may be given to using lifts in \naccordance with the following:  \ni) If the lifts servicing his floor also service the fire floor, they shall not be used.  \nHowever, lifts may be used if there is more than one bank of lifts, and he is informed \nfrom the Fire Command Centre that one bank is unaffected by the fire.  \nii) If lifts do not service the fire floor and their shafts have no openings on the fire floor, \nthey may be used, unless directed otherwise.  \niii) Lifts manned by trained building personnel or firemen may also be used.  \niv) In the absence of a serviceable lift, the Fire Warden shall select the safest stairway to \nuse for evacuation on the basis of the location of the fire and any information received \nfrom the Fire Command Centre. The Fire Warden shall check the environment in the \nstairs prior to entry for evacuation. If it is affected by smoke, alternative stair shall be \nselected, and the Fire Command Centre notified.  \nv) The Fire Warden shall keep the Fire Command Centre informed of the means being \nemployed for evacuation by the occupants of his floor.  \ng Ensure that an alarm has been transmitted.  \n \nD-9.3.4  Organization Chart for Fire Drill and Evacuation Assignment  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 110  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  A chart designating employees and their assignments shall be prepared and posted in a \nconspicuous place in each tenancy and on each floor of a tenancy that occupies more than \none floor and a copy shall be in the possession of the Fire Safety Director.  \nD-9.3.5  Keep available an updated listing of all personnel with physical disabilities who cannot use \nstairs unaided.

The aspect of pressurization, door area/width and door closure shall be planned in \nconsideration to the above.  \n \nE-3 Fire Safety Requirements for Lifts  \nThe provisions as given in 7.1 to 7.2.4 under fire safety requirements of lifts in high rise buildings in \nPart VIII ‘Building Services, Section 5 Installation of Lifts, Escalators and Moving Walks, \nSubsection 5A Lifts’ , National Building Code shall be applicable.  \n \nE-4 Horizontal Exit/Refuge Area  \nA horizontal exit shall be through a fire door of 120 min rating in a fire -resistant wall. Horizontal \nexit require separation with the refuge area or adjoining compartment through 120 min fire barrier.  \nThe adjoining compartment of the horizontal exit should allow unlocked and ease of egress and exits \nfor the occupants using defend in place strategy.  \nRequirements of horizontal exits are as under:  \n1 Width of horizontal exit doorway shall be suitable to meet the occupant load factor for egress.  \n2 Doors in horizontal exits shall be openable at all times from both sides.  \n3 All doors shall swing in the direction of exit travel. For horizontal exits, if a double leaf door is \nused, the right hand door leaf shall swing in the direction of exit travel.  \n4 Refuge area shall be provided in buildings of height more than 24 m. Refuge area provided \nshall be planned to accommodate the occupants of two consecutive floors (this shall consider \noccupants of the floor where refuge is provided and occupants of floor above) by considering \narea of 0.3 m2 per person for the calculated number of occupants and shall include additionally \nto accommodate one wheelchair space of an area of 0.9 m2 for every 200 occupants, portion \nthereof, based on the occupant load served by the area of refuge or a minimum of 15 m2, \nwhichever is higher, shall be provided as under:  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 115 a) The refuge area shall be provided on the periphery of the floor and open to air at least on \none side protected with suitable railings.  \nb) Refuge area(s) shall be provided at/or immediately above 24 m and thereafter at every 15 \nm or so.  \n5 The above refuge area requirement for H-2 occupancy requirement shall however be in \naccordance with life safety provisions for H -2 occupancy . \n6 A prominent sign bearing the words ‘REFUGE AREA’ shall be installed at the entry of the \nrefuge area, having height of letters of minimum 75 mm and also containing information about \nthe location of refuge areas on the floors above and below this floor. The same signage shall \nalso be conspicuously located within the refuge area.  \n7 Each refuge area shall be ventilated and provided with first aid box, fire extinguishers, public \naddress speaker, fire man talk back, and adequate emergency lighting as well as drinking water \nfacility.  \n8 Refuge areas shall be approachable from the space they serve by an accessible means of egress.  \n9 Refuge areas shall connect to firefighting shaft (comprising fireman’s lift, lobby and staircase) \nwithout having the occupants requiring to return to the building spaces through which travel to \nthe area of refuge occurred.  \n10 The refuge area shall always be kept clear. No storage of combustible products and materials, \nelectrical and mechanical equipment, etc. shall be allowed in such areas.  \n11 Refuge area shall be provided with adequate drainage facility to maintain efficient storm water \ndisposal.  \n12 Entire refuge area shall be provided with sprinklers.  \n13 Where there is a difference in level between connected areas for horizontal exits, ramps of slope \nnot steeper than 1 in 12 shall be provided (and steps should be avoided). 14 \n \nHigh rise apartment buildings with apartments having balcony, need not be provided with refuge \narea; however, apartment buildings without balcony shall provide refuge area as given above. \nRefuge areas for apartment buildings of height above 60 m while having balconies shall be provided \nat 60 m and thereafter at every 30 m.  The refuge area shall be an area equivalent to 0.3 m2 per \nperson for accommodating occupants of two consecutive floors, where occupant load shall be \nderived on basis of 12.5 m2 of gross floor area and additionally 0.9 m2 for accommodating wheel \nchair requirement or shall be 15 m2, whichever is higher.  \n \nE-5 Electrical Services  \nThe specific requirements for electrical installations in multi -storeyed buildings given in Part VIII \n‘Building Services, Section 2 Electrical and Allied Installations’ of the Code and Section VII of \nNational Electrical Code 2011 shall be followed.  \n \nWherever transformers are planned at higher floors, the HT cables shall be routed through a separate \nshaft having its own fire resistance rating of 120 min.  Wherever HT generators are planned centrally \nat ground or first basement level, redundant transformers and HT cables shall be planned for \nbuildings above 60 m in height.  \n \nE-6 Fire Protection  \nFor residential occupancies above 120 m in height and other occupancies above 60 m in height, the \nsprinklers shall be fed from the main and an alternate/standby riser with suitable isolation valves. \nThe entire sprinkler system shall be designed in accordance with good practice (Refer Annexure K \n(20)).  \nWhere the height of the building exceeds 150 m to 175 m, fire water static storage and pumps shall \nbe required to be provided at 160 m to 180 m and thereafter at intermediate floors at higher levels \nenabling efficient and functional firefighting installations. The static fire water storage tanks located \nat such levels shall have capacity at minimum half of the storage of underground static water storage \ntank prescribed in Table No. 14. 7.  Such tanks shall be supplemented with water supplies through \n \n14 Note — Refuge area provided in excess of the requirements shall be counted towards FAR.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 116  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  one working and one standby pump of capacity 2850 litre/min with two risers at alternate locations \nfeeding to such fire water static storage tanks.  The fire pump’s requirement and capacity shall also \nbe derived for occupancy type as per Table No. 14.7  substituting the diesel pump with electrical \npump. The fire pump room at such level shall have dedicated connectivity through passageway (with \n120 min integrity) from the firefighting shaft. Such fire pump room shall have 120 min fire resisting \nwall and provided with adequate ventilation with talk -back connectivity to the main fire pump room \nand Fire Command Centre.  \nFor high rise buildings, seismic bracings shall be considered for firefighting installations depending \non seismic vulnerability of the region and the type of occupancy.  \n \nE-7 Fire and Life Safety Audit  \n1 Fire and life safety audit shall be carried out for all buildings having a height of more than \n15 m.  \n2 Such audits shall preferably be conducted by a third party auditor having requisite \nexperience in fire and life safety inspections.  \n3 Frequency of such audits shall be once in two years.  \n \nE-8 Helipad  \nFor high rise buildings above 200 m in height, provision for helipad is recommended for specific \nrequirements like landing of fire equipment, and support facilities or other emergencies.  \n  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 117 ANNEX URE  F \n \nATRIUM  \n \nF-1 Atrium Requirements  \n1 In order for an atrium to be permitted in buildings, the following shall be complied:  \na) Atrium shall be permitted in buildings of Type 1 and Type 2 construction only.  \nb) The use of combustible furnishings and decorations on the floor of the atrium shall be \nlimited and sparsely distributed.  \n2 Smoke detectors shall be provided on the underside of each floor protruding into the \natrium, at the atrium roof and adjacent to each return air intake from the atrium. Within \natrium space, beam type or aspirating type smoke detectors shall be used to ensure \ndetection of smoke, considering factors such as stratification of smoke.  \n3 Where the ceiling of the atrium is more than 17 m above the floor, water based protection \n(automatic sprinklers) at the ceiling of atrium is not required.  \n4 Hydrants shall be available at the floor of the atrium and also at the adjoining upper \nspaces/floors of the atrium. Sprinklers are required to be installed for coverage of glass \nareas of retail, tenant and other areas adjoining the exit access corridor and atrium. \nSprinklers shall be at a distance of 450 mm to 600 mm enabling cooling of such glass and \nlimiting the extent of fire and smoke to the atrium (see Figure No. AF -1).  This provision \ndoes not allow similar sprinkler installation arrangement to offset fire compartmentation \nrequirements, in which case fire barrier is required as per relevant provisions of this Part.  \n5 Atrium in business occupancy shall be planned with 6 air changes per hour (ACPH) while \natrium in hotels and assembly occupancy shall be planned with 8 ACPH smoke extraction \nsystem. Such air changes shall be planned in atrium for a height of 15 m from the top.  \n6 Smoke exhaust fans shall be capable of operating effectively at 250°C for 120 min.  \n7 Makeup air supply points shall be located beneath the smoke layer and on the lower levels \nconnected by the atrium.  \n8 Makeup air shall be provided by fans, openings to outside to allow infiltration, or the \ncombination thereof.  \n9 It is recommended that makeup air be designed at 85 percent to 95 percent of the exhaust \nflow rate, not including the leakage through these small paths.  \n10 The makeup air shall not cause door -opening force to exceed allowable limits.  \n11 The makeup air velocity shall not exceed 1.02 m/s where the makeup air could come into \ncontact with the plume unless a higher makeup air velocity is supported by engineering \nanalysis.  \n12 Atrium smoke management system fans shall be provided with emergency power.  \n13 If so required by the Authority, an engineering analysis should be performed which \ndemonstrates that the smoke system for the atrium is designed to keep the smoke layer \ninterface 1800 mm above the highest occupied floor level of exit access, open to the \natrium, for a period equal to 1.5 times the calculated egress time or 20 min, whichever is \ngreater.  \n \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 118  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority   \nFigure No. AF -1: Sprinkler protection of glass for floor open to Atrium  \n  \n\nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 119 ANNEX URE  G \n \nCOMMERCIAL KITCHENS  \n \nG-0 General  \nThe provisions given herein are applicable to those commercial kitchens serving in centrally air -\nconditioned buildings such as kitchens of starred hotels, food courts, malls, banquet halls and \nrestaurants.  \nElectricity, gas and in some cases solid fuels such as wood or charcoal are the energy sources used to \npower a commercial kitchen.  \nThe potential hazards posed by the commercial cooking facilities are as follows:  \n1 On cooking appliances using oil as fuel — The oil can self -ignite due to overheating of the \ncooking appliances or through open flames.  \n2 Full grease residues trapped in the hoods due to non -cleaning of filters and dusts periodically \nand exhaust ventilation system can ignite through overheated air flues or open flames.  \n3 Faulty electrical equipment and electrical installation are more likely to spark, and failure of \nthermostat and safety switches that may lead to overheat and consequent fire.  \n4 Flammable materials in the vicinity of open flames or heat sources  \n \nG-1 Terms Associated with Cooking Operations  \n1 Types of restaurants/food preparation facilities  — Buffet restaurants, cafeterias, coffee \nshops, entertainment facilities (nightclubs, dinner theatres), and ethnic, fast food, speciality \nand traditional restaurants, corporate canteens, casinos, educational facilities, schools and \nuniversities, hospitals, care homes, mental homes and prisons.  \n2 Ventilation/grease extraction equipment  — Exhaust hoods, grease removal devices, \nexhaust ductwork, exhaust fans, dampers and other ancillary components or systems that \nare involved in the capture, Containment, and control of grease -laden cooking effluent.  \n3 Cooking appliances  — Ranges, deep fat fryers, microwave ovens, griddles, grills, \npressurized fryers, potato chip fryers, woks, broilers, doughnut fryers, barbecue/smokers, \novens, Tandoors, steam kettles, appliances initializing grease and cooking oils, etc.  \n \nG-2 Fire Protection Systems  \n1 A kitchen fire suppression system needs to be installed whenever cooking appliances are \nusing LPG/PNG/oil/electricity and/or dry fuel like wood or charcoal for cooking and/or \ncan ignite the exhaust or fat for cooking and/or can ignite the ventilation system. Cooking \nequipment that produces grease -laden vapours and that might be a source of ignition of \ngrease in the hood, grease removal device, or duct shall be protected by fire -suppression \nequipment.  \n2 The initial fire hazard is the cooking appliance itself. However, once the exhaust \nventilation system is involved in fire due to propagation from the appliances, the exhaust \nsystem becomes the more severe hazard due to the potential of fire propagation outside the \ncooking space.  \n3 The requirement for kitchen fire suppression systems shall be directly linked to \nmeasurements that actually represent the risk. Some other contributory factors could be but \nnot necessarily — connected load (kW), area occupied by kitchen equipment, volume of \ncooking oil and other flammables, inter distances between equipment, cooking media, etc.  \n4 Grease laden hoods can be ignited by heat penetrating the outside of the kitchen hood. Any \npenetration to the outside of a hood, shall be either welded or fitted with an approved \nsealing device so as not to allow cooking grease and oil to migrate to the outer portion of \nthe hood.  \n5 If sprinkler protection is specified for a building, it needs careful consideration of the likely \nconsequences if certain portion of the building is omitted from the scope of protection, for \nexample, no water should get on the cooking appliances (especially the fryer). Removing \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 120  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  this protection from a high hazard area logically requires this area to be protected by a \nmore suitable solution, dedicated to this special hazard.  \n \nG-3 FIRE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS  \n1 Where a kitchen is required for the preparation of food and/or where ‘open flame’ cooking \nappliances are used and/or where fryers (with no open flames) are used, the kitchen shall \nbe separated from other parts of the same building by compartment wall and floor having \nfire resistance of at least 60 min.  \n2 Food serving areas shall be fire separated from the kitchens/cooking areas by fire rated \nelements having a resistance of at least 60 min. Doors shall have fire resistance of 60 min \nrating and fitted with automatic self -closing device.  \n3 In open type kitchen cooking area, sitting area needs to be segregated by 60 min fire rated \nglass or drop fire curtains [ Refer  G-3(4) and G -5.2(2) ]. \n4 Where the flue or exhaust duct passes through the compartment wall or floor, the flue or \nduct shall be encased by non -combustible construction and no damper shall be permitted to \nbe installed in such flue or duct. Also such flue or ductwork shall be clear from \ncombustible materials.  \n5 If the commercial kitchen/cooking is situated in a building that is not sprinkler protected, \nthe floor area of the kitchen/cooking shall not exceed 50 m2. \n6 Commercial kitchen/cooking using LPG as fuel for the ‘open flame’ cooking activities \nshall not be allowed to be located at the basements. As regards LPG cylinder storage, \nattention is drawn to good practice (Annexure K(14))  and Part VIII ‘Building Services, \nSection II Electrical and Allied Installations’ of the Code for compliance requirements  \n7 It is advisable to locate the kitchen/cooking operations on the external periphery of the \nbuilding so that in the event of mechanical ventilation failure, it can be naturally ventilated.  \n \nG-4 Life safety and egress requirements shall be governed by the requirements under life safety \n(Refer Rule 14.3 ).  In case the requirements under this Annexure  differs from those under \nRule 14.3 , this Annexure  shall take precedence.  \n \nG-5 Fire Safety Requirements  \nG-5.1 General  \n1 The following equipment must always be kept in working condition:  \na) Cooking equipment,  \nb) Hoods,  \nc) Exhaust ducts (if provided),  \nd) Fans,  \ne) Fire extinguishing systems,  \nf) Fire detection and alarm system, and  \ng) Gas leakage detectors (if gas is used as fuel).  \n2 An automatic fixed suppression system shall be installed to protect all cooking equipment \nproducing grease laden vapours and that might be a source of ignition of grease in the \nhood, grease removal device.  \n3 Fire-suppression equipment shall be provided for the protection of grease removal devices, \nhood exhaust plenums, and exhaust duct systems.  \n4 All fire suppression systems and components installed shall be in accordance with relevant \nIndian and/or International Standards.  \n \nG-5.2 Protection of Cooking Equipment (General)  \n1 Cooking equipment shall be protected with the following:  \na Automatic wet chemical fire suppression system for the protection of hoods (OR) \nother equivalent approved systems like water mist applications for kitchen fires.  \nb Automatic sprinkler system for noncooking areas (not in the vicinity of cooking areas \nor inside hoods).  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 121 c Exhaust ducts shall be protected by automatic high temperature sprinklers designed as \nper good practice (Refer Annexure K(20))  \n2 Due diligence shall be exercised before considering protection with sprinkler/water mist \ninstallation particularly for the protection of fryers. No sprinklers shall be provided within \n3 m of cooking equipment and kitchen hoods. Area sensitive to sprinklers shall be \nprotected with wet chemical suppression systems or other approved systems for the type of \nprotection. Water mist systems, if approved for use for the type of application (that is, \ncommercial cooking equipment) by fire tests, may also be considered.  \n3 Kitchen hoods independent suppression systems shall discharge wet chemicals to all areas \nof a kitchen range extract hood that is potentially coated in grease. The system shall also \ndischarge over deep fat cooking pans or other potential fire source.

This \nshall exclude those incidental spaces which are occupied by cashier, attendant booth or \nthose spaces used for toilets, with a total area not exceeding 200 m2. \n4 Vehicle ramps shall not be considered as exits unless pedestrian facilities are provided.  \n5 Other occupancies like fuel dispensing, shall not be allowed in the building. Car repair \nfacilities, if provided, shall be separated by 120 min fire resistant construction.  \n6 In addition to fire protection requirements as per Table No. 14. 7, appropriate fire detection \nand suppressions systems shall be provided for the protection of hydraulic oil tank and \npumps located below ground level for operation of car lifts.  \n7 Means of egress shall meet the requirements specified in Rule 14.3 . \n \nH-3  Open Parking Structures ( Including Multi -Level Parking and Stilt Parking ) \n1 The term open parking structure specifies the degree to which the structure’s exterior walls \nmust have openings. Parking structures that meet the definition of the term open parking \nstructure provide sufficient area in exterior walls to vent the products of combustion to a \ngreater degree than an enclosed parking structure.  \n2 A parking structure having each parking level wall openings open to the atmosphere, for an \narea of not less than 0.4 m2 for each linear metre of its exterior perimeter shall be construed \nas open parking structure. Such openings shall be distributed over 40 percent of the \nbuilding perimeter or uniformly over two opposing sides. Interior wall lines shall be at \nleast 20 percent open, with openings distributed to provide ventilation, else, the structure \nshall be deemed as enclosed parking structures.15 \n3 All stilt parking are required to be provided with sprinkler system where such buildings are \nrequired to be sprinklered.  \n4 Open parking structures are not required to be provided with compartmentation.  \n5 Open car parking (open to sky) within building complex having fire hydrant system shall \nalso need to be protected with yard hydrant installation system in accordance with good \npractice (Refer Annexure K(29)).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 Note — A car park located at the stilt level of a building (not open to sky) can be considered an open or an unenclosed \ncar park if any part of the car park is within 30 m of a permanent natural ventilation opening and any one of the following \nis complied with towards the permanent natural ventilation requirement:  \ni) 50 percent of the car park perimeter shall be open to permanent natural ventilation.  \nii) At least 75 percent of the car park perimeter is having the 50 percent natural ventilation opening.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 124  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  H-4  Enclosed Parking Structures  \n1 Those car parking structures which are enclosed on all sides and on top, not falling within \nthe definition of open car parking [see H -3(2)] and also those situated in the basements \nshall be known as enclosed car parking structures.  \n2 All sprinklers in car parking shall be standard response type with minimum K -Factor of 80, \narea coverage of 9 m2 and designed as per good practice (Refer Annexure K(20))  \n3 For basement car parking, compartmentation can be achieved, with fire barrier or with \nwater curtain nozzle (K -23) or with combination thereof. Automatic deluge system \ncomprising deluge valve, piping, nozzles, etc. shall be used to zone the compartment in \ncase of water curtain system. In case of water curtain, existing water storage shall be \nsupplemented by water demand for water curtain nozzles for 60 min considering the \nlargest compartment’s perimeter out of all compartments of car parking in any of the \nbasements.  \n4 The water supply for the water curtain nozzles shall be through independent electric pump \nof adequate capacity (flow and head) with piping/riser for the water supply to the nozzles.  \n5 The water curtain shall be operated by the actuation of flow switch actuating sprinkler \nsystem.  \n6 For smoke ventilation requirement of car parking, Refer Rule 14.3.5 . \n7 All fire exit doors from the car parking to exits shall be painted green and shall display exit \nsignage.  \n \nH-5  Automated Car Parking Utilizing Mechanical or Computerized / Robotics \nMeans  \n1 Automated car parking structure can be of open parking type or enclosed types.  \n2 Automated car parking facilities pose more hazard compared to manual parking due to \nfollowing reasons:  \na) High density of cars due to close stacking one over another.  \nb) Lack of provision on fire separation/ compartmentation -horizontal or vertical leading \nto rapid fire spread.  \nc) Non-availability of any person to notice/ control the fire in initial stages.  \nd) Limited access to firefighting personnel.  \ne) Extensive height and depth involved with highly combustible load.  \n3 Fire escape staircases, at least 1250 mm wide shall be provided at appropriate locations so \nthat no place is more than 45 m from the nearest staircase.  Horizontal walkways, at least \n1000 mm wide for access to all the areas shall be provided at every parking level.  \n4 Travel distance and means of egress shall be governed by the respective sections of this \nCode.  \n5 The hazardous areas like DG sets, transformers, HT/LT panels for the parking lot shall be \nsuitably segregated from other areas as per requirements given in this Code and all such \nareas shall be protected by suitable automatic fire suppressions systems.  \n \n  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 125  \nANNEXURE  J \n \nFIRE PROTECTION CONSIDERATIONS FOR VENTING IN INDUSTRIAL \nBUILDINGS  \n \nJ-1 Application  \nJ-1.1 The provisions given below are applicable only to single storey industrial buildings \n(factories and storage buildings) covering large floor areas without sub -dividing/separating \nwalls which are usually designed to meet modern production methods.  \nJ-1.2 The requirements of fire and explosion venting of industrial buildings, as dealt with in this \nsection, fall under two categories:  \na) Smoke and fire venting, and  \nb) Explosion relief vents.  \n \nJ-2 Smoke and Fire Venting  \nJ-2.1 The basic considerations for formulating the design and other requirements for smoke and \nfire vents are as given in J -2.1.1 to J -2.1.20.  \nJ-2.1.1  The smoke and hot combustion products from a fire, being lighter than the surrounding air, \ntend to rise, and on reaching the roof or ceiling spread out (mushroom) on all sides and \nform a layer which floats on top of the cold air beneath. In the absence of vents, this layer \nbecomes progressively deeper until the whole building is filled with hot smoky gases. The \ntime consumed for this to happen may be only a few minutes, depending on variables like, \ntype of materials on fire, process/storage conditions involved, etc.  \nJ-2.1.2  The hot gases at the roof level moved by convection currents contribute to rapid lateral \nspread of fire.  \nJ-2.1.3  The provision of properly designed and suitably located vents in adequate number helps \nthe speedy removal of smoke and hot gases, thereby preventing spread of fire, besides \nreducing risks of explosion of unburnt gases and reducing damage to the contents and \nstructure of the building by heat and smoke. In addition, they facilitate firefighting \noperations, and minimise personal hazards to the firemen.  \nJ-2.1.4  The time taken for accumulation of smoke and hot gases within a building on fire being \nvery short, the venting devices installed shall be designed to operate in the early stage of \nthe fire and must be automatic so as to ensure speed and efficiency in their operation.  \nJ-2.1.5  The smoke and fire venting system shall be designed in such a manner as to keep the \ntemperature of the combustion products from the fire as low as possible, preferably below \napproximately 150°C.  \nJ-2.1.6  Automatic venting systems are complementary to the fire extinguishing systems, and \nautomatic sprinklers, where provided, should operate before the operation of the vents; \notherwise, venting may delay sprinkler operation.  \nJ-2.1.7  It is easier to vent a building of smoke than clear it of smoke once it has been filled.  \nJ-2.1.8  Venting is particularly desirable in large area industrial buildings or warehouses, \nwindowless buildings, underground structures or in areas housing hazardous operations. \nAutomatic fire vents shall be provided for all industrial occupancies (including storage \nbuildings) classified as medium hazard or above having floor areas exceeding 750 m2, \nirrespective of whether they are compartmentalized or not.  \nJ-2.1.9  These provisions do not cover other aspects, of ventilation (or lighting) designed for \nregulation of temperature within a building for personal comfort or meeting process needs.  \nJ-2.1.10  Similarly, fire and smoke venting requirements as given here under are also not applicable \nto multi -storeyed buildings, as their requirements are different and more complex.  \nJ-2.1.11  It is difficult to determine precise venting requirements on account of the many variables \ninvolved. For instance, the rate of combustion varies appreciably according to the nature, \nshape, size and packaging of the combustible materials as well as the size, height and \ndisposition of the stacks of materials.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 126  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  J-2.1.12  In industrial buildings of floor area less than 750 m2 and used as low fire hazard \noccupancies, conventional ventilators fitted high up near the eaves of the external walls \nmay serve as vents for smoke and hot gases, provided care is taken to ensure that they are \nkept open at all times or are designed to open automatically in case of fire.  \nJ-2.1.13  Extinction of fires by closing the doors and windows is not likely in the case of industrial \nbuildings because of their large size, where sufficient air to sustain the fire at least in the \ninitial stages can be expected to be present.  \nJ-2.1.14  Of the two types of building ventilation, namely, vertical and horizontal, vertical \nventilation is the one commonly adopted in the case of single storey industrial buildings.  \nJ-2.1.15  Since 70 to 80 percent of heat produced in a fire is convective heat, the ventilation system \nhas to be suitably designed to ensure early outflow of the heat and thereby minimise fire \nspread.  \nJ-2.1.16  Combustible roof linings shall be avoided, as they themselves will contribute to the spread \nof fire, thereby multiplying the venting problems.  \nJ-2.1.17  A wind blowing across a flat roof or a roof with a pitch under 40° produces a negative \npressure, that is, it tends to draw gases out of the building and so aids venting of hot gases. \nWind blowing across a roof of pitch greater than 40° will draw gases out on the leeward \nside but oppose outward flow on the windward side of the roof.  \nJ-2.1.18  For vents to work at full efficiency, the area of the inlets for cold air entering the \ncompartment must equal at least the total area of the vents. Ideally, the inlets shall be as \nclose to the ground as possible.  \nJ-2.1.19  Where roof vents are installed in a single storey building any neighbouring buildings, \nparticularly those of more than one storey, will be subject to some degree of exposure \nhazard either from flying birds or radiation, or both, as a result.  \nJ-2.1.20  If vents are to be installed, the size, design, number and disposition of the vents and the \nassociated roof screens/curtain boards have to be assessed after careful analysis of the \nvarious factors stated under J -2.1.11, as well as other related factors like type of building \nconstruction, nature and height of roof, process hazards, exposure hazard, etc.  \n \nJ-2.2 Venting Area  \nJ-2.2.1  The estimated requirements for ventilation are largely based on the assumed build -up of \nthe fire from the time of initial outbreak to the time of effective firefighting action by fire \nbrigade.  \nJ-2.2.2  The vent area required to be provided shall be approximately proportional to the perimeter \nof the fire area, because the entrained air forms the bulk of the vented gases.  \nJ-2.2.3  The effective area shall be the minimum cross -sectional area through which the hot gases \nmust flow out to the atmosphere.  \nJ-2.2.4  No consideration shall be given to the increased air movement obtained by power operated \nfans, since it must be assumed that in the event of fire, power will be interrupted, or fans \ndamaged by heat.  \nJ-2.2.5  The total vent areas to be provided shall be as per the following ratios of effective area of \nvent openings to floor area for various occupancy classifications indicated:  \na) Low heat release content - 1: 150 (Sub -division G -1) \nb) Moderate heat release - 1: 100 contents (Sub -division G -2) \nc) High heat release - 1: 30 to 1: 50 contents (Sub -division G -3) \n \nJ-2.3 Types of Vents  \nJ-2.3.1  Venting shall be accomplished by any of the types such as monitors continuous gravity \nvents, until type vents or saw tooth  roof skylights.  \nJ-2.3.2  Where monitor type vents are installed, wire glass or metal panels shall be used only if the \nsash is arranged to open automatically.  \nJ-2.3.3  The use of plain thin glass for venting shall be avoided on account of its unpredictable \nbehaviour during fire. However, if glass or other suitable plastic sheet materials with early \ndisintegration characteristics are used, they should be designed for automatic operation.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 127 J-2.3.4  Where monitors or unit type vents are used, the panels shall be hinged at the bottom and \ndesigned to open automatically. Both sides of the vents shall be designed to vent \nsimultaneously to ensure that their effectiveness at the time of fire is not in any way \nimpeded by wind direction.  \nJ-2.3.5  Where movable shutters are provided for continuous gravity vents, these shall open \nautomatically in the event of fire.  \nJ-2.3.6  Unit type vents shall be of relatively small area, ranging between 1 m2 and 9 m2, having \nlight weight metal frames and housing with hinged dampers which shall be designed for \nboth manual and automatic operation.  \nJ-2.3.7  Sawtooth roof skylight shall be considered as satisfactory for venting purposes only when \ndesigned for automatic operation.  \nJ-2.3.8  Likewise, exterior wall windows shall not be reckoned as satisfactory means for venting of \nfire gases and smoke in industrial buildings. However, they may be reckoned as additional \nmeans of venting when, they are located close to the caves and are provided with ordinary \nglass or movable sash arranged for both manual and automatic operation.  \nJ-2.3.9  Baffles shall not be installed inside vents, as they greatly reduce the effective area for \nventing.  \n \nJ-2.4 Vent Operation  \nJ-2.4.1  The vents shall be automatic in operation, unless where specified in these provisions that \nthey shall be designed for both manual and automatic operation.  \nJ-2.4.2  The release mechanism shall be simple for operation and independent of electrical power, \nsince electrical services may be interrupted by fire.  \nJ-2.4.3  The automatic operation of vents shall be achieved by actuation of fusible links or other \ntypes of heat and smoke detectors, or by interlocking with operation of sprinkler system or \nany other automatic fire extinguishing system covering the area. Following their release, \nthe vents shall be designed to open by a system of counterweights and associated \nequipment utilizing the force of gravity or spring loaded levers.  \nJ-2.4.4  Automatic fire alarm system, where installed, shall be coupled to the automatic vents to \nensure simultaneous operation.  \nJ-2.4.5  Automatic sprinklers, where installed, shall operate before the vents open order to avoid \nany likely delay in sprinkler operation. However, heat actuated devices used for vent \nrelease shall be suitably shielded from sprinkler discharge so that water does not delay \ntheir action. Further, provision of operating the vents manually may also be provided.  \nJ-2.4.6  Premises where height of roof apex is 10 m or more or where the materials handled or \nstored have high smoke producing characteristics, in addition to fusible links, the vent \nrelease mechanism shall be interlinked to smoke actuated automatic fire detectors to ensure \nearly operation of vents.  \nJ-2.4.7  Non-corrosive materials shall be used for hinges, hatches and other related parts to ensure \nlong fail -safe operation of the vents.  \nJ-2.4.8  In case of any doubts regarding the types of vents required to be installed for any particular \noccupancy, authorities having jurisdiction shall be consulted.  \n \nJ-2.5 Size, Spacing and Disposition of Vents  \nJ-2.5.1  Vents shall be correctly sited to ensure their functional efficiency. Ideally, they shall be \nsited at the highest point in each area to be covered.  \nJ-2.5.2  They shall, as far as possible, be located immediately above the risk to be protected so as \nto allow free and speedy removal of smoke and other combustion products in the event of \nfire.  \nJ-2.5.3  The minimum dimension for an effective vent opening shall be not less than 1.25 m in any \ndirection.  \nJ-2.5.4  The spacing of the individual vent shall be based on the principle that more number of well \ndistributed smaller vents are more effective than fewer number of badly located larger \nvents.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 128  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  J-2.5.5  The maximum spacing between vents for the three occupancy classifications shall be as \nfollows:  \na) Low heat release:  45 m between centres content  \nb) Moderate heat:  36 to 37 m between release content centres  \nc) High heat release:  22.5 to 30 m between content centres, depending on the severity of \nfire potential.  \nJ-2.5.6  Vents shall be placed in a sheltered situation where advantage can be taken of the \nprevailing wind. The design of the vent shall be such as to produce a suction effect. A wind \nblowing across a flat roof or one with a pitch of 40° produces a negative pressure, that is, it \ntends to draw gases out of the building and so aids venting of hot gases.  Wind blowing \nacross a roof of pitch greater than 40° will draw gases out of the leeward side, but oppose \noutward flow on the windward side of the roof.  \nJ-2.5.7  Low level inlets, with total area not less than the total area of vents, shall be provided to \npermit outside air to be drawn in to aid automatic venting. These inlets, which may be in \nthe form of doors, windows or such other openings, shall be designed for manual operation \nwhen desired.  \n \nJ-2.6 Roof Screens or Curtain Boards  \nJ-2.6.1  Industrial buildings with large areas and having no subdivision/separating walls limiting \nthe area of individual compartments to 750 m2 or less, shall be provided with roof screens \nor curtain boards.  \nThese screens which extend from the roof downwards at specific intervals not only prevent \nlateral spread of heat and smoke in the event of fire below, but substantially assist in early \noperation of automatic sprinklers and vents.  \nJ-2.6.2  They shall be of sheet metal or any other substantially non -combustible material strong \nenough to withstand damage by heat or impact.  \nJ-2.6.3  They shall be reasonably gas -tight, although small openings for passage of pipes, conduits, \netc., shall be permitted.  \nJ-2.6.4  They shall extend down from the roof/ceiling for a minimum depth of 2.2 m. Around \nspecific hazards, the depth shall be 4 m. Where roof/ceiling height exceeds 15 m they shall \nextend down to within 3 m of the floor. For pitched saw -toothed roofs, they shall extend \ndown to truss level dividing the roof into compartments.  \nJ-2.6.5  In moderate hazard occupancies, the distance between the screens/curtain boards shall not \nexceed 75 m and the curtained areas shall be limited to a maximum of 4500 m2.  \nJ-2.6.6  In high hazard occupancies, the distance between screens shall not exceed 30 m and the \ncurtained area shall be limited to 750 m2. \nJ-2.6.7  The curtained roof area shall be so arranged that they effectively aid in the venting of \nsmoke and hot gases through the automatic vents provided in each area.  \nJ-2.6.8  In sprinklered buildings, the screens shall preferably be so located as to coincide with the \nindividual sprinkler system areas.  \n \nJ-3 Explosion Relief Vents  \nJ-3.1 Industrial premises where combustible dusts can accumulate or where flammable gases, \nvapours or mists in explosive concentrations may be present are constantly exposed to \nexplosion hazards. Pressures developed by such explosions may be of the order of 7 × 105 \nPa and ordinary buildings will not be able to withstand the shock of such pressures. Hence, \nsuch buildings require explosion relief vents for preventing structural damage.  \n \nJ-3.2 Basic Principle/Considerations  \nJ-3.2.1  Most ordinary building walls will not withstand a sustained internal pressure as great as 6.9 \nX 103 Pa.  Hence, explosion relief vents for buildings must be designed to operate at \npressures well below those at which the building walls will fail.  \nJ-3.2.2  There is a rise in pressure during an explosion within an enclosure even with open, \nunobstructed vents, and any delay in opening the venting devices increases that pressure.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 129 J-3.2.3  Structural damage can be minimised by locating hazardous operations or equipment \noutside buildings and cut -off from other operations by a pressure resisting wall. Such \nisolated processes or equipment shall be housed in single -storey buildings properly vented \nand a device provided at the inlet of the collector which will prevent an explosion from \nblowing back through the duct work and into the building.  \nJ-3.2.4  Where highly hazardous operations cannot be located outside of main buildings, they shall \nbe segregated by pressure resisting walls and each such unit shall be ventilated outdoors. \nExternal walls may be of heavy construction, if equipped with suitable vents or high \nweight panels which blow out easily.  \nJ-3.2.5  Operations or equipment involving explosion hazards shall not be permitted in basements \nor areas partially below grade.  \nJ-3.2.6  Fire can be expected to follow an explosion in most occupancies, so that any fixed fire \nextinguishing equipment, like sprinklers, if installed, shall be such that only the minimum \ndamage is caused to it.  \nJ-3.2.7  For a given material, the finer the particle size of the dust, the more violent is the \nexplosion. Some materials, such as aluminium powder, hydrogen, and acetylene, are \ndifficult to vent effectively due to the rapid rate of pressure rise. Some slow burning \nmaterials, such as coal dust in a confined space, may do much damage because of the \nlonger duration of their presence. Some dusts, such as magnesium, titanium and zirconium \nand several metal hydrides may react with and ignite in some common inert gases, such as \nnitrogen and carbon dioxide.  \nJ-3.2.8  The maximum explosion pressure in a vented structure decreases as the size of the vent \nincreases but is independent of the rupturing pressure of a diaphragm.  \nJ-3.2.9  The most effective vent for the release of explosion pressures is an unobstructed vent \nopening.  \nJ-3.2.10  Pressure required to rupture diaphragms of the same area and material directly varies with \nthe thickness of the material.  \nJ-3.2.11  The slower the rate of pressure rise, the more easily can the explosion be vented.  \nJ-3.2.12  The degree of venting required is directly proportional to the degree of explosion hazard.  \nJ-3.2.13  Experience has shown that most explosions of dusts, vapours and gases do not involve a \nlarge part of the total volume of the enclosure, and frequently occur near the upper or \nlower limits of the explosive range. Consequently, such explosions are relatively weak \ncompared with the optimum.  \nJ-3.2.14  Rectangular unrestricted vents areas effective as square vents of equal area.  \n \nJ-3.3 Types of Explosion Relief Vents  \nJ-3.3.1  The explosion relief vents shall be any one or more of the following types, depending on \nindividual requirements as assessed by the Authority. Open or unobstructed vents, louvres, \nopen roof vents, hanger type doors, building doors, windows, roof or wall panels or \nmovable fixed sash.  \nJ-3.3.2  The effect or external wind pressure or suction on these devices shall be taken into \nconsideration while designing and selecting the type of vents, since wind pressures may \nreach over 2 × 105 Pa in severe wind storms.  \nJ-3.3.3  The type of vent for explosion relief for any occupancy shall be selected with life safety as \nthe primary aim followed by minimum damage to property.  \nJ-3.3.4  Where large hanger type doors of metal curtain doors inside walls are used as vents, care \nshall be taken to ensure that they are kept wide open during operations.  \nJ-3.3.5  Where weather hoods are used to cover roof vents, they shall be as light as possible and \nlightly attached so as to enable them to be blown off quickly when an explosion occurs.  \nJ-3.3.6  Doors and windows when used as explosion vents shall be installed to swing outwards. \nDoors shall have friction, spring or magnetic latches that will function automatically to \npermit the door to open under slight internal pressure.  \nJ-3.3.7  Movable sash shall be of the top or bottom hinged or protected type. These shall be \nequipped with a latch or friction device to prevent accidental opening due to wind action or \nintrusion. Such latches or locks shall be well maintained.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 130  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  J-3.3.8  Fixed sash shall be set in place with very light wall anchorages, or, if tight, shall be \nsecurely fitted and glazed with plastic panes in plastic putty.  \nJ-3.3.9  Where the process is such that the whole of a building or a room may be desirable to \narrange for a lightly constructed wall or roof to collapse and thus avert the worst effects of \nan explosion.  \n \nJ-3.4 Design, Size and Disposition of Vents  \nJ-3.4.1  The required area of explosion vents shall ordinarily depend on the expected maximum \nintensity of an explosion in the occupancy, the strength of the structure, the type of vent \nclosure and other factors.  \nJ-3.4.2  Venting shall be planned in such a manner as to prevent injury to personnel and damage to \nexposure. In congested locations, substantial ducts or diverters shall be provided to direct \nthe blast.  \nJ-3.4.3  When ductwork is used, the ducts shall be of sufficient strength to withstand the maximum \nexpected explosion pressure.  \nJ-3.4.4  Where explosions are likely within duct and piping systems, they shall be vented by the \nuse of suitable diaphragms designed to blow out at a predetermined pressure. There shall \nbe no physical connection between ductwork system for more than one collector.  \nJ-3.4.5  In large structures, the position of vents shall be relative to the point of origin of explosion, \nwhen it can be determined.  \nJ-3.4.6  Where relatively slow explosions involving coal dust, chlorinated solvents, etc, are \ninvolved, light, hinged swinging panels may be preferred to diaphragm type of vents.  \nJ-3.4.7  Obstructions of any kind blocking the vents from the risk covered shall be avoided, \nparticularly where risks of rapid violent explosions are present.  \nJ-3.4.8  Counterweights add to the inertia of the vents and so shall be avoided.  \nJ-3.4.9  Various relieving devices, including devices actuated by detonators, shall start to open at \nas low a pressure as possible. They shall be of light construction, so that full opening can \nbe quickly attained.  \nJ-3.4.10  Vents shall be of such size and design as to prevent rupture of the protected device or \napparatus.  \nJ-3.4.11  Skylights or monitors with movable sash that will open outwards, or fixed sash containing \npanes of glass or plastic that will blow out readily under pressure from within, can be used \nto supplement wall vents or windows, provided resistance to their displacement or opening \nis kept as low as consistent with the requirements for structural strength.  \nJ-3.4.12  Flexible plastic sheets when used for vent closures shall be installed in slotted frames in \nsuch a way that pressure from within bulges the sheets and releases them from the holding \nframe.  \nJ-3.4.13  Fragile sheets made of plastic, when used for vent closures, shall be thin sheets that will \ncrack or rupture under less pressure than single strength glass. For this reason use of \ntransparent or translucent plastic sheets is more advantageous than use of glass in window \nsash.  \nJ-3.4.14  If closed vents are used they shall be larger in area than unenclosed vents to provide \nequivalent explosion pressure relief.  \nJ-3.4.15  Small enclosures, such as machines, shall be vented more generously than buildings, \nbecause if an explosion occurs in a machine, its entire volume may be involved.  \nJ-3.4.16  Vents for the protection of buildings and equipment shall be installed on the following \nbasis:  \n1 Small enclosures of less than 30 m3, machines and ovens of light construction: 1000 \ncm2 for each 0.3 m3 to 0.9 m3. \n2 For small enclosures of more substantial construction having reasonably high bursting \nstrength: 1000 cm2 for each 0.9 m3. \n3 Fairly large enclosures of 30 to 700 m3, such as bins, silos, rooms, storage tanks, etc: \n1000 cm2 for each 0.9 m3 to 1.5 m3.  In these cases, attempt shall be made to the extent \npossible to predict the likely point of origin of the explosion in relation to the vent.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(II), 2023  \nDadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority    Page No 131 4 Large rooms and buildings over 700 m3 containing hazardous equipment comprising a \nsmall fraction of the entire volume:  \na) For heavy reinforced concrete, walls: 100 cm2 for each 2.25 m3. \nb) For light reinforced concrete, brick or wood construction: 1000 cm2 for each 1.65 \nm3 to 2.25 m3. \nc) For lightweight construction such as prefabricated panels: 1000 cm2 for each 1.5 \nm3 to 1.65 m3. \n5 Large rooms or building over 700 m3 containing hazardous equipment comprising a \nlarge part of the entire volume of a room or building shall be vented as generously as \npossible: 1000 cm2 for each 0.3 m3 to 1.05 m3. \n6 In order to obtain these ratios, the size of the building or room must be limited. For \nsome hazardous materials, such as hydrogen, acetylene, carbon disulphide, etc., these \nlimits are extremely low.  \n7 Emphasis shall always be placed on segregating hazardous areas by means of firewalls \nor separating walls to prevent spread of fire.  \n8 Interior walls of light construction, such as tile, shall be avoided in hazardous locations, \nsince they can cause injuries to personnel in the event of an explosion.  \n \n  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I I), 2023  \nPage No 132  Dadra and Nagar Haveli Planning and Development Authority  Annexure  K \n \nLIST OF STANDARDS  \n \nThe following list records those standards which are acceptable as good practice and accepted \nstandards in the fulfilment of the requirements of the Rule .
