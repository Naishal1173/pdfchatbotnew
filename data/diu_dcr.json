Margins to be maintained from a designated water body shall be as prescribed in these \nRules. \n2 In any land designated under any legislation, for public purpose, the uses shall be permissible as \nper the requirements of these Rules. \n3 The land/plot allotted to any Government or Government Autonomous body like Municipality,  \nDistrict Panchayat, Planning and Development Authority, or a Government Company  under \nTown Planning  Scheme for public purpose shall be utilized for uses under 'Public Purpose' as \nper the applicable zones or road widths  prescribed in these Rules subject to suspension of any \nprovision of these Rules by the Government under Section 6 4 of the Act . \n3A Subject to these rules, the government may undertake any development without obtaining any \npermission under GDR, whether of a temporary or permanent nature, that are crucial for the \ncommunity's well -being and public welfare. However, they must first secure the requisite \napproval from the competent authority as mandated by applicable laws, orders, notifications, or \ncirculars that may be in effect at any given time.  \n4 Every development shall have to conform with the presently recommended land  use except in \nthe following cases:  \na) The existing buildings constructed as per previously recommended land use shall be \nallowed to be repaired or retrofitted.  \nb) The old use shall be permitted only until the useful life of the building.  \nc) Subject to these General Development Rules, any new development shall be permitted \nonly when it conforms with the presently recommended land use in presently earmarked \nzone.  Provided that any person who has done part construction in his building unit in \naccordance with a valid construction permission, shall be allowed to apply for construction \npermission in conformity with the use to which the building unit is being used for within \none year of the final publication of these rules.  \nProvided further that any new construction shall have to comply with existing CRZ, Coast \nGuard, ASI regulations, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Notification \n(2015), etc. 5 For all zones, if the line of a zone divides a building unit, the right of the \nplot holder to the FSI shall be determined as per following principles.  \na) For plots whose part comes under CRZ, Coast Guard, or ASI the owner/developer may \neither treat his plot as constituted of two separate plots and construct two buildings \nconsuming the FSI  available on these hypothetical parts —calculated on the basis of area of \nthese supposed parts , or he may consume higher FSI available calculated on the basis of \narea of entire plot subject to condition that he shall be allowed construction only on the \npart of the plot where higher FSI is available.  \nb) If in such cases the Developer goes with First option, the u se of each building unit shall be \nregulated as per respective  zones.  \nIn both cases , other development restrictions shall be applicable.  \nc) For cases, where 50% or more plot falls in the higher FSI zone then the developer shall be \nallowed higher of the two FSIs available. If less than 50% of the plot falls in higher of the \ntwo FSI zones, then then the maximum permissible built up shall be based on the FSI of \nthe respective zone.  \nFor contiguous development, the maximum  permissible built-up area in the building unit shall  \nbe based on FSI of respective zone.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I) -B, 202 4 \nPage No 64  Diu Planning and Development Authority  6 Utility structures shall be permitted in any  zone except Preservation Zones but shall be subject \nto all applicable Rules and Regulations for the time being in force.  \n7 Permissible use of a building shall be determined by the zone , the plot area  and the abutting \nroad width of the building unit .   \n8 For Eco-Sensitive Zone  / Area shall also confirm the notification published by the “Ministry of \nEnvironment and Forest”, Notification no. S.O. 1067 , dated, 14th September  2006” and  amended \nfrom time to time.  \n9 Any mixed -use building having industry as one of the use s, shall only be allowed in industrial \nzone. Residential and Industrial use shall not be allowed in the same building.  \n10 Land  Use Zoning in Hazard Prone Areas  \nIn natural hazard prone areas namely the earthquake prone zones as per IS:1893, the cyclone \nprone areas as per IS:875 Part  – 3 and flood prone areas as per the Flood Atlas prepared by the \nCentral Water Commission and/or the flood departments of the Government , the development \nshall be regulated to ensure special protection from hazards for any type of development \nirrespective of use zone.  Whereas the hazard prone areas identified as per the Vulnerability \nAtlas of India , 1997  (hereinafter referred as Atlas) (or revisions thereof) prepared by \nGovernment of India or as may be prepared by Government from time to time shall be used for \nsuch regulations, as given in Appendix  B of the Atlas.  Further action for protection from these \nhazards is to be dealt with taking into consideration the guidelines given in Table  No. 7.1 \nhereunder : \n \nTable No.7.1: Protection of Buildings Structure s and Infrastructure s in Hazard Prone  Areas  \nA Protection o f Areas from Earthquakes  \n(i) In those areas where there are no dangers of soil liquefaction or settlements or landslides, all \nbuilding structures and infrastructures should be designed using the relevant Indian Standards as \nprovided in the Building Regulations and the National Building Code  \n(ii) Soils subjected to liquefaction potential under earthquake shaking, can be improved by compaction \nto desired relative densities, so as to prevent the possibility of liquefaction.  \n(iii) Buildings and structures could be founded on deep bearing piles going to non - liquefiable dense \nlayers.  \n(iv) Steep slopes can be made more stable by terracing and construction of retaining walls and breast \nwalls, and by ensuring good drainage of water so that the saturation of the hill -slope is avoided.  \n(v) Any other appropriate engineering intervention to save the building structures or infrastructure \nfrom the fury of the earthquake.  \nNote:  \nThe protective action given under (ii) to (v) in this table, will usually involve large amount of costs and \nshould only be considered in the case of large and costly structures.   For ordinary buildings the cost of \nimprovement of the site will usually be uneconomical, hence bad sites should be excluded by Land Use \nZoning.  \n \nB Protection  from Cyclonic Wind Damage  \ni) Buildings, structures,  and infrastructures in the cyclone prone areas should be designed according \nto the Indian Standards and Guidelines as provided in the Regulations and the latest National \nBuilding Code.  \nii) Light utility structures used for electrical transmission and distribution, and towers for \ncommunications, chimneystacks of industrial structures require special design considerations \nagainst the cyclonic wind pressures, suctions,  and uplifts.  \niii) In case the buildings, structures and infrastructures are founded on marine clay deposits it will be \nadvisable to adopt either under -reamed piled foundations, or individual column footing with a \nreinforced concrete beam located at the level of the ground, or a continuous reinforced concrete \nstrip footing.  \niv) Wherever, the topsoil  could become slushy due to flooding, the top layer of 30 cm depth of soil \nshould not be considered for providing lateral stability.  \nv) In storm surge prone areas, it will be preferable to construct the community structures, like \nschools, cyclone shelters, etc. by raising the level of the ground protected by provision of retaining \nwalls at sufficient distance away from the building, taken to such depth that no erosion takes place \ndue to receding storm surge. Alternatively, construct the community structures on stilts with no \nmasonry or bracing up to the probable maximum surge level.  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I) -B, 202 4 \nDiu Planning and Development Authority   Page No 65  \nC Protection of Areas from  Floods  \nThis may require one or more of the following actions : \ni) Construction of embankments against the water spills from the source of flooding like rivers, large \ndrain etc.  \nii) Construction of high enough embankments  / bund s around the planning area.  \niii) Raising the planning area above the high flood level.  \niv) Construction  / improvement of drainage paths to effectively drain the water from the planning \narea.  \nv) Construction of buildings and structures on deep foundations going below the depth of scour or  on \nstilts with deep enough foundations underwater.  \nvi) Flood proofing works such as the following:  \nvii) Providing quick drainage facility, consisting of  \na) Revitalisation of secondary and primary drainage channels after establishing the drainage \nblockage points.  \nb) Provision of additional waterways.  \nc) Clearing of clogged cross drainage works.  \nviii) Providing human and animal Shelters for population living within embankments in the form of \nraised platform or use of available high ground.  \nix) Anti-erosion actions in affected areas.  \nx) Any other suitable measure.  \n \nNote s: \n1 Similar protection methods could be used against flooding caused in cyclone prone areas by high \nintensity rains or by the storm surge.  \n2 The concept of land zoning should be kept in mind for areas where protection works are taken up to \ndecide inter -se priority for location of structures considering possibility of failure of protection works \nduring extreme disaster events . \n \n15 For Railway Container Depot the permission shall be issued for development of structures of \nthe Railway Department . \n16 Permissible uses as mentioned in Table No. 7.2 are broad indicators of the type of use \npermissible in each zone.  In case any dispute arises whether or not an activity falls within the \npermissible use of a zone, concerned Planning and  Development Authority shall be the \nCompetent Authority to decide such issue.  \n17 In case of mixed -use buildings with residential and permissible non-residential  uses, either on \nthe ground floor or any other floors, they shall be provided with separate means of access / \nstaircase.  \n \nTable No. 7.2: Classification of Land Use Zones  and Permissible Uses  in Outline Development Plan  \n(Diu District ) \nNo. Zones  Conceptualized \nZone  Code  Permissible Use referred as code  \n(Code detailed in Table No. 7.3)  \n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) \n1 Preservation Zone -I \n(CRZ IA and IB) *  Preservation \nZone  PZ-I EP1, EP2  \nAll activities as per CRZ  \n2 Preservation Zone -II Preservation \nZone  PZ-II EP1, EP2, REC1, TEMP (Except \nConcrete batching plant)  \n3 Preservation Zone -IIA \n(CRZ IA)  As per CRZ -\n2019  PZ-IIA Permissible activities as per CRZ -\n2019  \n4 Preservation Zone -IIB \n(CRZ IB)  As per CRZ -\n2019  PZ-IIB Permissible activities as per CRZ -\n2019  \n5 Preservation Zone -IIC \n(CRZ III -

It shall also be as far removed \nfrom the nearest  habitable building is economically feasible but not closer than 2  m to avoid damage \nto the structure.  \n \n3 Dimensions and Specifications  \na) Septic tank shall have a minimum inner width of 75  cm, a minimum depth of one meter \nbelow the water level and a per capita minimum liquid capacity of 120 litres . The length of  \nthe tanks shall be least twice the width.  \nb) Septic tanks may be constructed of brick work, stone masonry, concrete, or other suitable \nmaterial as approved by the Competent Authority.  \nc) Under no circumstances should effluent from a septic tank or allowed into an open channel \ndrain or body of water without adequate treatment.  \nd) The minimum normal diameter of the pipe shall be 100  mm.  Further at junction of pipes \nin manholes, the direction of flow from a branch connection should not make an angle \nexceeding 45 degrees with the direction of flow in the main pipe.  \ne) The gradients of land‐drains, under‐drainage as well as the bottom of dispersion trenches \nand soak wells should be between 1:300 and 1:1400.  \nf) Every septic tank shall be provided with a ventilating pipe of at least 50  mm diameter. The \ntop of the pipe shall be provided with a suitable cage of mosquito proof wire mesh. The \nventilating pipe shall extend to a height which would cause no smell or nuisance to any \nbuilding in the area. Generally, the ventilating pipe should extend to a height of about 2  m \nabove the septic tank  if it is located within the proximity of 15 m of the building.  \ng) When the disposal of a septic tank effluent is to a soak pit , the soak pit may be of sectional  \ndimension of 90  cm and not less than 100  cm in depth below the inner level of the inlet \npipe.  The pit may be lined with stone, brick and concrete blocks with dry open joint which \nshould be backed with at least 7.5  cm of clean coarse aggregate.  The lining above the inlet \nlevel should be narrowed to reduce the size of the RCC cover slabs.  Where no lining is \nused, especially near trees, the entire  pit should be filled with loose stones .  A masonry \nring should be constructed at the top of the pit to prevent damage by flooding of the pit by \nsurface run off.  The inlet pipe should be taken down to a depth of 90cms from the top a s \nan anti‐mosquito measure.  \nh) When the disposal of septic tank effluent is to a dispersion trench, the dispersion trench \nshall be 50 to 100  cm wide, excavated to a slight gradient and shall be provided with a \nlayer of shed gravel or crushed stones 15 to 25  cm deep.  Open, joined pipes placed inside \nthe trench shall be made of unglazed earthenware clay or concrete and shall have a \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I) -C, 202 4 \nDiu Planning and Development Authority   Page No 145 minimum internal diameter or 70 to 100  mm.

The dimensions of this connecting sewerage line should be determined in accordance \nwith the type of building/ intended development on the said plot with the minimum size of pipe \n15cm diameter. An occupancy certificate will not be issued without the provision of this sewerage \nline. \n \n \n13.10 Electrical Infrastructure  \nAdequate electrical infrastructure as published in the National Building Code of India, Part VIII ‐ \nBuilding Services, Section 2‐ Electrical Installations, shall be provided in all buildings to the  \nsatisfaction of the Competent Authority . \n \n \n13.11  Digital Communication Infrastructure  \nA broad variety of Information Communication Technology (ICT) systems are expected to be \ninstalled in buildings.  In order to facilitate proper cabling and installation /  up gradation of ICT \nsystems and their cost effectiveness and maintenance, adequate physical infrastructure is required \nwithin buildings. This infrastructure will include common ducts, cable riser systems, conduits, cable \ntrays and utility closets etc. among other things.  The same can also be retrofitted into existing \nbuildings wherever possible and feasible and must be designed in all new, re -developed and \nrenovated structures.  Sharing of in building infrastructure will save capex and opex, as well as avoid \nduplication of infrastructure deployment  by multiple providers .  \n \nProvision for  in building s for ‘Common Telecommunication Infrastructure ’ (CTI)  is mandatory in \nDwelling 3 , Mercantile  2 & 3 , Assembly  1, 2, 3 & 4 , Hospitality  1, 2 & 3, Education 2 &3, Health 1, \n2, 3 & 4, Service Establishment 2, Industrial 1, 2 & 3 , Transport, Storage and Public Offices  etc. \n \nCTI needs duct sharing and fibre sharing.  It will need s pace and power  for installation of common \nducts, optical fibre, small cells, antennas, smart sensors etc.  Earthing requirements may also be \nthere for some ICT. In some cases , there may be more specific requirements  for utility spaces such \nas: \n• Cable routing layout and cable length restrictions between Workspace  and utility closet.  \n• Bending radius and  working clearance requirements for different cable  types, e.g. Fiber  optic \ncables, Cat -6 Cables and co -axial cables . \n• Isolated power circuits for permanent communication equipment . \n• Protection,  Safety, Grounding,  and environmental requirements of  communication equipment.  \n \n13.11.1  Solutions for In -Buildings and Gated Buildings  \n1 The buildings are to be constructed in such a way that they are ‘digital connectivity ’ ready.  For \nthis they need to provide  common telecom ducts / pathways to reach accessible parts of the \nbuildings.  They should also have properly demarcated sections within buildings and on \nrooftops  for housing broad band / digital connectivity infrastructure / antenna.   These areas \nshould have access to power supply for reliable,  always -on services.  \n2 These common telecom ducts / pathways can be used /shared  by various TSPs/IP -1s for laying / \ndigital infrastructure including cables.    \n3 Further the TSPs/IP -1s shall be given unhindered access inside the buildings to install the \ntelecom  infrastructure / cables etc , as well as for their maintenance .  This access can be free of \ncharge or for a standardized nominal charge like other utilities.   \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I) -C, 202 4 \nPage No 146  Diu Planning and Development Authority  13.11. 2 Provisions a t the Layout Level  \n1 While developing Greenfield cities/towns, the layout plans should clearly indicate the telecom \nas Utility infrastructure lines.  \n3 The placement and sequence of above  and below -ground utilities at the appropriate location in \nthe right -of-way shall be ensured for unconstrained movement as well as easy access for \nmaintenance.  \n4 Telecommunication cables should be placed in a duct that can be accessed at frequent service \npoints with sufficient spare capacity to enable scaling and future expansion, and empty pipes \n(large size hume pipes / HDPE pipes) should be laid before planting trees in order to \naccommodate additional infrastructure.  \n5 Telecommunication cables should ideally be placed below the parking area or service lane, \nwhich may be dug up easily without causing major inconvenience. Where this is not possible, \nthe cables may be placed at the outer edge of the right -of-way.  \n6 There is a need to reduce conflicts with pedestrian movements is to place telecom boxes in \neasements just off the right -of-way. Where this is not possible, they should be placed within \nparking or landscaping areas. If cables have to be located in the pedestrian path, a space of at \nleast 2m should be maintained for the through movement of pedestrians. Telecom boxes should \nnever constrain the width of a cycle track.  \n7 To minimize disruptions, cables should be installed with proper maintenance infrastructure.  \n \n13.11.3  Provision of I n Building Solution C omponents (as per NBC 2016)  \n1 Entrance Facilities (EF) /Lead -in conduits: ( NBC 2016 Clause 3.1.4, of Part VIII: Sec 6) min. \n1.2 m x 1.83 m space to be allocated for each TSP adjacent to the Entrance Facility.  \n2 Underground conduits/pipes to MDF room: min 100mm dia encased conduits.  \n3 Main Distribution Frame (MDF)/Equipment Room  (ER):  \n(NBC 2016 C lause 3.1.2, Part VIII: Sec 6)  \na) prescribed size with L:W ratio between 1:1 to 2:1  \nb) appropriate ventilation of MDF room  \nc) proper Lighting for vision of equipment.  \nd) located at a level above from the ground level  to avoid incidence of  flooding  \n4 Electric distribution panels, isolators , sockets and earthing as per specific  requirements w ith \nrespect to  the area proposed for coverage (DUs/ service subscribers) . \n5 Telecommunications Room (TR) at each building block unless provided with  MDF room  (all \nprovisions of space to be as per NBC 2016 Clause 3.1.3.2, Part VIII: Sec 6)  \n6 Appropriate nos. of  Service  / Telecom risers (vertical shafts) for all multi  storeyed  buildings \nw.r.t the area proposed for coverage (DUs/ service subscribers):  \na) of appropriate numbers  and size (width & depth) to accommodate cable trays  \nb) with access door at each floor.  \n7 Telecommunications Enclosures  (TE) at each floor of a block or TR  (NBC 2016 Clause 3.1.5, \nPart VIII: Sec 6) . \n8 Telecom Media and Connecting Hardware  (TE)  (NBC 2016 Clause 3.2, Part VIII: Sec  6) \n9 Various cabling system and trays  (NBC 2016 C lause 3.2.4, Part VIII: Sec  6) \n10 Wireless systems  (NBC 2016 C lause 3.2.5, Part VIII: Sec  6) \n11 Backbone Cabling Media Distribution and Building pathways  (NBC 2016 Clause 3.3, Part VIII: \nSec 6) \n12 Horizontal Cabling Media Distribution and B uilding pathways  (NBC 2016 Clause 3.4, Part \nVIII: Sec  6) \n13 IBS installation spaces: area for rooms or systems (eg. , antennas, base  stations, remote units, \npower distribution boxes etc.) to be provided as per  requirements w ith respect to the area \nproposed for coverage/ no. of proposed users ( NBC 2016 C lause 3.1.3.2, Part VIII: Sec  6 and \nTable No. 13.10 & 13.11 ) \n  \nGeneral Development Rules - Part 3(I) -C, 202 4 \nDiu Planning and Development Authority   Page No 147 Table No. 13. 10: Telecom room space norm for buildings with Built -up area >465 sq  m \nNo Area to be covered by IBS  Size of Telecom Room (m)  \n1 Upto 465 sq m  3 x 2.4  \n2 465 sq m to 930 sq m  3 x 3.4  \n3 More than 930 sq m  Additional TR required with same space norms  \n \nTable No. 13. 11: Space requirements  for smaller buildings with Built -up area <465 sq  m \nNo Area to be covered by IBS  Space provisions (m)  \n1 Upto 93 sq m  Wall cabinets, self – contained enclosed cabinets  \n2 93 sq m  to 465 sq m  Shallow Room (0.6 x 2.6)  \nWalk -in Room (1.3 x 1.3)  \n \nIBS installation s paces, so provided, should be:  \n1 Not susceptible to flooding.  \n2 Not exposed to water, moisture, fumes, gases, or dust.  \n3 Able to withstand designed equipment load (to be specified in design)  \n4 Located away from any vibrations to avoid dislocation/dislodgement.  \n \n13.11.4  Proce ss for obtaining IBS -NOC for Development permission and Occupancy \nCertificate  \n1 While submitting the application of development permission, the applicant shall also submit : \na) A complete Service Plan for IBS -infrastructure along with required  specifications (in \nconsultation with, and certified by a credible Telecom  Networking hardware -consultant)  \nb) An undertaking that such IBS Infrastructure, when constructed shall be  available for \nsharing by various TSPs/IP -Is. \n2 Such Service Plan (IBS) shall be forwarded by the concerned Local  Authority to the Telecom \nEnforcement Resource and Monitoring (TERM)  cell of the State  (external NOC agency) – for \napproval NOC.  \n3 During the Joint Site Inspection of the completed building structure the  TERM cell shall \nundertake inspection of the constructed/installed IBS  infrastructure – for issuance of NOC for \nOC. \n4 The Competent  Authority shall liaise with the TERM cell as per its relevant  online/offline \nprocess of communication to seek the relevant NOCs within  the specified time as per the \nService Charter  / Service Guarantee Act and  rules in place.
